Hey everyone, Steven here from the trading channel and today as you can see I will be sharing with you how my December went as far as trading It's been a couple of weeks since I put a video out and that's because December is a very slow month for me with the holidays around the corner and The low volatility and thin markets. I try my best not to make many trades in December I actually have an entire set of rules just for December that tell me when I can when I'm allowed to trade In December because of the thin markets so far in December I think I've only made about eight or nine trades and today I'll be sharing those with you So go ahead and subscribe hit that like button for me, and I'll be back right after the intro and disclaimer All right guys, so before we get started I will quickly go ahead and plug in all of the numbers of the trades we've made so far in December into our spreadsheet so that you can see the way that looks on an equity curve So this month in the month of December we have so far lost 41 on the euro dollar Minus 41 here Then we made 94 on the dollar yen We lost five on the pound dollar We made 102 pips on the Aussie CAD and And we made 65 pips on the pound Swiss in the month of December so far and we have two open trades out But I don't count either of those one of them is in the profit and the other one is at a loss right now But I'm not gonna count either of those until they close So what I'll do now is go ahead and go through the charts and explain to you all of these trades that I made this week And also explain the trades that I'm in and why I am in them at this point in the month All right, so we're gonna start on the euro dollar today and I actually took a loss on this trade this week And it was because of being impatient and not looking left for structure a lot of mistakes came into this trade And that's not usual for me But it did happen and I want to share it with you so that you can avoid making these kind of mistakes in the future for yourself what I seen coming into the market was an ABCD pattern here If I copy this paste it here as you can see we came down into an ABCD pattern and at the time I'm just gonna Color this white And show you what I was looking at at the time we had put in a nice double bottom here and also Down here on the RSI at the time We had put in Some RSI divergence As you can see right here So I took this trade On that candle right there And the reason I did that was because I had a CTS score of four And that's what I have to have in my trading strategy in order to take a take a trade is a CTS a combined technical score of at least four And if you're not familiar with the combined technical score then go ahead and subscribe to this channel later on I'll be doing a video explaining how to create your own Combined technical score so if that sounds like something you're interested in then subscribe and you'll be alerted by email whenever that does come out But back to the charts, so we have this double bottom here. We also have our side of virgins down here and I had an ABCD pattern so for me that was a combined technical score of four and The reason that this was a bad trade is because I took this trade without looking left and seeing this structure level right here so instead of being Patient and waiting for a better entry closer to this structure level. I was impatient with my entry entering here on this candle and Having targets up Here at previous structure support And stops I put just below this double bottom Right in there So as you can see I had the right idea just the wrong entry and the reason I had the wrong entry is because I did not look left for this structure my stops definitely should have went below this any other time They would have but as I said, I made a mistake and I was not paying attention whenever I placed the straight So this is this ended up being a loss because of that and I wanted to show you that so that you can avoid doing that later on in the future Always look left for a structure level close to your stop as you can see My stops were right at the structure level and that's never a good idea. You always want to be below the nearest structure low if you're buying and Actually if I go out to a four-hour chart, you'll see that this area here Turned out to be a really good buying opportunity Let's head on out to the four-hour Right up against previous structure here Created a double bottom and Did have RSI divergence as well and oversold RSI right here So that definitely would have been a better opportunity if I would have been more patient and paid attention to the chart All right moving on the next pair. We're gonna take a look at is the dollar yen And on the dollar yen we had a cipher pattern win on the four-hour chart For those of you familiar with advanced patterns in the cipher pattern you can probably already spot this one But just in case you're not it comes in from here x to a A to B B to C CD completion right in There let's see how well I guess that Oh pretty close pretty close So our cipher pattern ended here on the 786 Retracement and some news came out About the yen, I can't remember exactly what the news was I don't really pay attention to the news because I'm strictly a technical trader but that news calls the big spike and Then followed by a huge decline in the dollar versus the yen My targets were at the 382 retracement My stops were above X And as you can see the cipher pattern really doesn't give you a great risk to reward profile But it is so accurate that it counteracts the bad risk reward you have on these trades And if you're not familiar with the cipher pattern then go ahead and subscribe to the channel because I will be doing a video Explaining how to trade the cipher pattern a little bit later on this week Alright moving on to the next pair is going to be the pound dollar And here on the one-hour chart you can see that we have a cipher pattern setting up for a possible trade coming into next week and Also, I took a 786 trade this week on the pound dollar As you can see we came up broke structure here To the upside and to this level consolidated retraced rallied retraced then broke above structure here to the upside and for those of you that have already seen my 786 strategy then you know what I'm about to do for those of you that haven't Then check it out the link is on the bottom left as a video about a trend continuation strategy that I use in the markets and The way this strategy works is you wait for a breaking close above structure Then pull a Fibonacci retracement I bought the 786 Targets at previous structure and stops below The swing low to give me a really good risk reward profile And I actually got out of this trade for break even using a little bit of trade management and the way I Got out of this and the reason I got out of this was because of a couple of different things the first thing was I seen This head and shoulders set up shoulder one head Shoulder two over here And also these wicks Here Are showing me selling pressure right here at the opposite shoulder of the head and shoulders pattern also if you look back We actually closed below our lowest structure level here We closed below that here if I just delete a few of these things you can see that a little better and that pretty much Takes my reason for being in the trade away I was in the trade for turn continuation to the upside Which means I'm expecting the market to continue up before breaking through these lows and closing below these lows But the market closed below those lows so now my expectation is a continue a Continued trend to the downside not a retest of this structure level So that's a few of the reasons that I got out of this trade and I ended up getting out for break even which was much much Better than accepting a loss on this trade Next we'll look at the dollar Swiss. Oh And here out on the four-hour chart we have a setup going right now We have a 786 Trade and as I said before if you are not familiar with that trade I do have a tutorial on the trade and I'll post a link at the bottom left of your screen But right here as you can see we broke below this structure level And then came back up to a 786 retracement giving us a pretty good risk to reward taking targets down at previous structure and Stops are above the most previous swing high Moving on the next pair we'll look at is the Aussie cat and The Aussie cat gave us a 786 trade this week I've already got their trace met drawn on my chart so as you can see market broke above closed above this structure level here Then I took a Fibonacci retracement from swing low down here up to swing high Balt the 786 targets back up at previous structure Stops down below the swing low Setting us up with a pretty good risk to reward profile and hitting targets pretty easily Next up the euro Aussie here on the euro Aussie we have a Bat pattern setting up going into next week I'll give you a second to see if you can identify it and if you're not familiar with the bat pattern then check out the tutorial I have on my channel. I'll post a link in the bottom left explaining the ratios of the bat pattern and how to trade it This bat pattern is coming in like x to a Hey to be B to see and CD completion right down here at the 886 Pretty close and a lot of people think that Once a market starts to consolidate a little bit that this bat pattern is now invalid because of this rally and that's not the case as long as we don't break above Our c-point right here. I Mean we have gotten close but as long as we don't break above that then this is still a valid bat pattern until we either break above that or hit our entry and Next up is the pound Swiss and On the pound Swiss we had a cipher pattern. I'll give you a second to see if you can see it If you're not familiar with the cipher pattern then go ahead subscribe to the channel I'll post a link in your bottom left and I'll be doing a video on the correct ratios of the cipher pattern and how to trade it This particular cipher pattern Comes in from this leg x to a A up to B B to C down here and the CD completion At the very top of this week we barely got filled here, but we did get filled and We also did come down and hit targets pretty easily as you can see Target's at the 382 Stop above x As you can see the trade worked out in our favor the last pair we'll look at today is the euro pound and This is a trade that I've posted on trading view if you're interested in seeing the way that I Examine the market live then go ahead and follow me on trade and view. I'll post a link in the description below this is just an example of If I go out to the four hour chart, it's a lot easier to see this is just an example of our side of urgency and the way I trade it So we've had higher highs Here on price action. I know this looks a little messy, but once I explain it it'll get a lot easier We've had higher highs here On price action and we have lower lows here on the RSI And also we put in all these long wicks up here that indicate selling pressure And we also have a triple top coming in and with all those indications that we should see some kind of drop in this market soon I decided to short the market here at 0.7 to 8 and Look for targets down here at the previous structure lows and also I'm shooting for some secondary targets down here at this structure level and Hopefully this will this analysis will pay off if not that's fine I've given myself a pretty good risk to reward profile so I can be wrong one and a half times for every time that I'm right and That's gonna do it for this week guys Hope you enjoyed that.
