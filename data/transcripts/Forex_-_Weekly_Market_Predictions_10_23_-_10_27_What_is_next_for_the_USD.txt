We talked about last week We talked about this level as being a possible level that could support this market Reason being because of all the times we have seen support and resistance out of the same level in the past Look right here. You can see this level acted as resistance multiple times So that leads us to believe that we could see a nice bounce off this level And that's something we'll be paying attention to for the remainder of this week We'll be looking for some buying opportunities here out of the dollar Swiss in this zone Now if we do get those buying opportunities out of this level the next key level of structure We'll be looking at to take off targets and to possibly go short here on the dollar Swiss is at the 0.9873 zone So back on this current dollar Swiss chart you can see that analysis worked out quite nicely Pushing all the way up to our next level of resistance from the area we pointed out in last week's video And now that we've done that we're actually at a level of resistance here around the 0.9873 zone This is an area we'll be looking for shorting opportunities down on lower time frames So something really important to remember guys that we discussed a lot here at the trading channel is just because the markets at these really Important these key levels that we've pointed out doesn't mean we're gonna automatically take a trade from these levels a trading strategy consists of Not only entry reasons of not only conditions But conditions combined with entry reasons to give you an edge over the market and even that still does not mean that we trade Every single time there is let's say a shooting star candle at resistance That's not a trading strategy either This can be the start of a trading strategy But you have to have specific rules that define the conditions if we're trading shooting stars at every level of resistance What defines a level of resistance? Write those rules out what defines the shooting star candle right those rules out Now we have to get even further into it. Where are we gonna put our stop loss? Where is our target gonna go based on this strategy? So there's a number of different rules that you need to consider a number of different Aspects to a trading strategy in order to make it rules based and easy to follow now after the creation of a strategy You still are not done just because you've created a strategy doesn't mean it's going to be profitable And if you have a strategy, let's say is 45% accurate And it gives you a one-to-one risk reward ratio If you tested strategy and this is what you came up with would you consistently trade this strategy? No, if you stay disciplined to this strategy, you're going to trade yourself directly into an empty trading account So how do we figure out if we have a strategy that gives us an edge over the market or strategy? Let's say is 55% accurate at a one-to-one risk reward How do we find that information out? What we have to look through historical data in a process called backtesting and this is why backtesting is so important Not only does it help you with trading psychology and discipline It's also the only way you're going to be able to tell if you have an advantage of the market whenever you place a trade So those are some important details that I thought you should definitely consider while trading If you don't have a backtesting spreadsheet and you'd like to get your hands on the one that I use personally There's a link in the description for that labeled spreadsheet mastery course But now let's continue to talk about the dollar Swiss here We are at this level of resistance and that's exactly what we're going to be looking for It's our specific entry reasons to go short here on this pair other than that if the market does break above this resistance level that we're at currently at the 0.9873 Area then we'll be looking at the 0.9974 zone as our next level of resistance and our next level for a shorting opportunity If this market pushes down from the level we're at currently we'll be looking yet again at the 0.9740 level for support And if we break below that area then we'll be looking at the 0.9628 zone as our next level of support So that's what we're looking for here out of the dollar Swiss rationally move on to the dollar yin now And take a look at what we're expecting out of this pair for the rest of the week So let's go ahead and move on to the dollar yin So here on the dollar yin we were looking at 111.79 area of support last week We talked about the market possibly being able to push up from that level We had a market that was breaking above structure resistance after structure resistance, right? And then we broke above our daily resistance as well We pulled back into that daily resistance pushed up once more and then pulled back into that same Daily resistance that it now becomes support and then we got a nice push off this market as well So i'll show you guys a very quick clip of last week's market predictions video Where we were pointing out the 111.79 area on the dollar yin And then we'll come back and discuss an interesting reason that actually happened on a smaller time frame on this pair So let's head to that clip and i'll be right back All right traders so here we're on that dollar yin pair and we're actually floating around a level of structure We talked about in last week's video For a possible trade to the upside we're floating around a possible buying opportunity zone here on this pair So for the immediate future on this pair we'll actually be looking for a buying Entry reason since we are floating around this zone This zone means our conditions have been met and now we're going to be waiting on our actual entry reason from this area To take this trade going long now. There is a situation So the dollar yin analysis from last week working out quite nicely market pushing all the way up to that 114 even handle and if you saw last week's video You'll know that that 114 even handle is actually an area of resistance that we were looking for to take a short position from if we get Some kind of entry reason so that's what we're going to be paying attention to here in the immediate future on the dollar yin And we'll talk a little more about that in just a second But for now let's go ahead and go down to a smaller time frame to check and see if we can find some kind of entry reason in this area At the 111.79 zone So here we are on the one hour time frame our blue line represents the 111.79 area of support Do you see a way we could have gotten involved in this trade for those of you with double bottoms and double tops in your trading plan Then you absolutely have a nice potential trade right here with this double bottom at our previous level of major Structure now does that mean that we need to take every single doe about them and double top at these levels of structure? Well, the answer to that is yes and no it depends on what's in your trading plan guys If you just go out there and blindly place trades based on doe bottoms and double tops without some kind of conditions You need met in the market without a certain place you know You want to put a stop loss in a certain place for targets chances are you will not be successful using this That is why having a trading plan is so important So let's head back out to the daily chart and talk about some other levels We're paying attention to throughout the rest of this week on the dollar yin All right, so for this pair just as we were discussing a second ago We're sitting right at the 114 even handle This is a place we'll be looking for shorting opportunities throughout the week And if we break above that area then we'll be looking at the 115 even handle for our next shorting opportunities Now if this market falls from this area and we'll be paying attention yet again at the 111.79 area for a buying opportunity If we break below that we'll be looking at 110.73 zone for our next buying opportunity here on the dollar yin So those are some of the things we're paying attention to on the dollar yin for the rest of the week Let's go ahead and take a look at our next pair. We'll move on to the euro dollar So here on the euro dollar not much has changed since last week's video last week We did have a trading opportunity from this area. We ended up hitting some pretty nice profits on the way down here And currently this market still floating in between the 1.1686 zone and the 1.1872 zone So for the immediate future we may be looking for this market to continue down and possibly get to Our 1.1686 area if that happens then we're gonna be looking for a long opportunity from that area But if this market breaks below that area then we have a long ways to go down all the way to the 1.1453 area for our next level Of major support and through this area is when we'll be looking for shorting opportunities on the way down And if we get down to that 1.1453 that's where we'll look for another long trade possibility now as for resistance if this market pushes up We'll be looking at the 1.1872 zone yet again for our first level of resistance And if we push above that then we'll be looking up at these highs over here around the 1.2050 All the way to the 1.2060 zone for our next level of resistance here out of the euro dollar What we're going to do now is go ahead and move on to the Aussie dollar All right guys So last week we discussed the 0.7893 area is being an area we were looking at for a shorting opportunity The market had already pushed down off of that level by the time we released the video But we talked about if there was a pullback up into that level we'd be looking there for a shorting opportunity on this pair So i'm going to play you guys a short clip from last week's video on the Aussie dollar And then we'll be right back to discuss the analysis and some entry reasons that could have been taken advantage of out of this pair But now this market has pushed up into our next level of resistance based on this higher time frame chart at 0.7893 So that's going to be something interesting to keep an eye on for the rest of the week Maybe we'll get a nice little pullback up into that level and an entry reason to go short out of this Aussie dollar pair But for now we have to change So as you can see guys this market did end up pushing back up around the 0.7893 zone And then immediately pushed down yet again from that level now Let's head down to a smaller time frame and take a look at a trading opportunity on this pair right around that level So we've now zoomed down to a one hour time frame and yet again for anyone with double tops and double bottoms in your trading plan Do you see an entry reason that you could have had on this time frame based on last week's analysis? We look right here. You can see this nice double top formation that came in one top neckline Double top and the market proceeded to push down pretty nicely from that area So that's what we were discussing last week here on the Aussie dollar Let's go ahead and zoom back out to a daily chart And take a look at what we can expect throughout the rest of this week on this pair So currently this market right below the 0.7819 area if this market pulls back up and the body of that candle closes above That zone then we'll be looking at this level as support yet if we close below this level Then we'll be looking at that level as resistance next it'll be the 0.7819 level as the first level of resistance If we get a close below that level and if the market pushes down from that level then the level of support will be paying attention to is around the 0.7735 area in that area is where we'll be looking for long trades if we break below that our last level of support We're going to be looking at is a 0.7618 zone here on the Aussie dollar Now if this market pushes back up then we'll be looking yet again at the 0.7893 zone as a level of resistance We can pay attention to foreshorting opportunities if we get above that We got a pretty long ways to go all the way up to our 0.8023 area here on the Aussie dollar So those are the things we'll be paying attention to throughout the rest this week and probably into the next few weeks here on the Aussie dollar Go ahead and move on to our final pair, which is going to be the pound dollar So here on this pound dollar chart not much changed But we do have this 1.3237 level that was support last week now changing into a resistance level here on this pair So right now hovering around that resistance level at 1.32 37 So level we'll be looking at foreshorting opportunities out of this pair if we push down from that level our first level of support We'll be around the 1.3056 level for the pound dollar if we push below that at 1.2850 We'll be the next level of support we look for long opportunities if this market pushes up and continues higher We'll be looking at the 1.3441 zone as a level of resistance to look for shorting opportunities out of this pair And if we push higher than that then we'll be looking at the highs right over here For our next shorting opportunity around the 1.3597 zone So in the immediate future for this pair looking for shorting opportunities around the 1.3273 zone And that's what we're paying attention to do this week out of the pound dollar and out of the top five major pairs Throughout this video We've talked a lot about backtesting and creating a trading plan around a rules based strategy And if you'd like to learn a little more about those subjects and learn more about the entry reasons that we use here at the trading channel Then all of that information is provided to you in the eap training course The eap training program has already helped many traders on their path to becoming profitable And I'll throw some of their testimonials up on the screen in front of you now This course also includes weekly analysis provided to you through email That shows you trades that i'm planning to take throughout the week And we send those out at least three to five times each and every week So if you're someone who's been struggling and consistently losing money and you'd like to try Something new and invest in your trading education Then check the eap training program out by clicking the link in the description If you got value out of today's video then make sure to go ahead and click that like button to help support the channel Don't forget to hit that subscribe button if you're new to make sure you're learning whenever you come out with new weekly market prediction videos As well as new educational videos each and every friday Also, if you'd like to get your hands on the backtesting spreadsheet that I personally use Then you can find out more about how to do that by clicking the link in the description labeled spreadsheet mastery course Thank you guys for checking out this week's video.
