What's up dude, it's Steven. In this video, we're going to be talking about the best currency pairs for you if you are a beginner and you're starting out with a smaller account and also some of the pairs you should avoid like the plague if you are a beginner starting with a small account. Before we get started, let's do some really scary math. So let's take a look at the board. Let's say you're a beginner starting out with a $100 account. Let's say you're trading on a currency pair that moves a ton. You're making this mistake. You're trading on a volatile currency pair with a small account and you're just starting out your trading. Let's say that pair is the pound yen. Let's say the pound yen is moving 100 pips on average on the four hour chart. You're a normal trader so you enter the close of a candle. You put your stop loss safely below that candle and that gives you a 100 pip stop loss. Here's the scary part. Most brokers on a minimum allow you to trade 0.01. Most brokers minimum size for you to trade is a micro lot. So what is a micro lot? That's 10 cents per pip. Now if we multiply that 10 cents per pip by 100 pips, that means that this trade is a $10 risk on your account. And I know $10 doesn't sound that scary for most of us. But only $100 account, $10 is a 10% risk. And if you go around risking 10% every time you place a trade, you are setting yourself up for an absolute disaster. And that is why in today's video, I want to talk to you about the pairs. You should be avoiding if you're a beginner with a small account and some of the pairs that are more safe to trade that can help you avoid this type of detrimental situation for your account.

I'll see you on the other side of the disclaimer to talk about the best currency pairs for a beginner starting with a small account. See you soon. Welcome back to the video. And let's do a quick example to prove this point. So let's say we have a really simple strategy. Our strategy is we trade when a candle closes above the 50 day moving average, we put a stop loss below the low of that candle. And it doesn't matter what our target is for the sake of this example. So let's go ahead and do that here on the pound. Yeah, right now we're on the pound. Yeah, and that's the pair we were talking about earlier. We have our entry, our stop loss goes below the low of that candle. Let's say by 10 pips 57, that would be a 67 pips stop loss at this point. Let's use the same example. Let's say that you have a $100 account. Your broker makes you the minimum you can trade with is a 0.01, which is normally equal to about 10 cents per pip. If we have a 67 pips stop loss, then what we have to do is multiply 67 pips times our 10 cents. And what this is going to do is give us our risk on this trade. That means that we're risking $6.70 on this one trade. This is on the pound. Yeah, with this particular situation, right? And with this being the case, $6.70, I know again does not sound like a lot of money, but on a $100 account, that's a 6.7 risk. And to give you context, personally, I never risk over 2% on any trade. Sometimes I risk much less than that, depending on how confident I am on that trade. And I've been trading for a decade. I'm on my 10th year right now. So if you're starting out as a complete beginner, you're probably going to lose a few more trades than I do. And if you're losing at 6.7% instead of at 2% or lower, your chances of blowing that account are very high. This is the reason a lot of traders blow accounts. So pound again, it's going to fall under the category of the pairs you want to avoid. If you are starting out with a very small account. Now, let's switch roles, let's flip the coin and land on the other side and talk about some of the pairs that are better for this type of situation. And then I'm going to dive into what you need to be looking for specifically on currency pairs to fall under the category of the pairs that you should be trading as a beginner with a small account. So let's jump over now to the Canada Swiss. Let's say we have the same exact strategy, but the last time here on this pair was a bearish version of this strategy. We have a market that closes below the 50 day moving average. Our entry is the close of that candle or stop loss is above the high of that candle. So let's go ahead and set that up. We have an entry at the close of the candle. Stop loss above the high will do the same 10 pips stop loss above the high of that candle, which would be 18 pips. And again, for this situation, the target doesn't matter. But in this case, say you're in the same exact position, right? $100 account. Micro lot 0.01, you're risking 10 cents per trade times your 18 pips stop loss. That means you're risking a $1.8 in this case. And nothing really has changed. You're trading the same exact strategy. The only thing that changed was the currency pair you're trading that strategy on. And because of that, you were able to put yourself at a 1.8% risk, which is much, much safer than your 6.7% risk you had on the pound. And the only reason for this difference is because of the volatility of each of these markets, some pairs trade at a very high range, meaning like on the pound in the range of those candles is very large on an hourly chart. Whereas on the candidates with you're a lot safer with your stop loss of your trading with a small account. And let's talk about now, since you have a good example of what I'm talking about, let's discuss how we actually find out which pairs we should trade. So in order to find out which pairs you should trade, you need to get really familiar with the ATR or average true range indicator. It is available on all platforms. On trading, you just go to indicators type in average, and it will be there as the second one down average true range. Apply it on your chart. And the reason we need this indicator is because it measures the volatility. What this indicator does is gives you the average, I don't know why I started with VAVG average of the last 14 candles. So what that gives you is a good idea as to how much that markets moving. And if you're trading with a really small account and you have a minimum lot size of 0.01, a micro lot, and you're trying to reduce the risk you have, the best idea is to start trading currency pairs that have a smaller ATR. Because at times the volatility in the markets change. And you already know that, I'm sure. And with that being the case, what we need to do is be able to measure the volatility of the market that we're going to be trading in so we can manage that risk and manage our stop loss. And with a small account, if you're a beginner, was let's say a $100 account, this is something that's going to be very important to your trading and something that's going to help you stay away from blowing your account and hopefully, ultimately, help you to stay in the markets long enough to learn what you need to learn and become eventually a professional and profitable trader. So that's the whole point of this is to stay in the market longer. You're going to make mistakes as a beginner. You don't want to be risking 6.7% 10% per trade on these really volatile pairs in that case. And the way we find out if a pair is volatile is, of course, the ATR indicator, a good rule of thumb would be to tell yourself that you're not going to trade on a pair that has over a 20 ATR. If you're trading on the hourly chart, you can find a few pairs that that is the case with. Some of the pairs that you might think about are the euro dollar, Canada Swiss, the euro pound normally has a very small ATR or small range, those candles trade in. So those are kind of the top three in terms of small ranges, where if you have a smaller account, you can make yourself safer in terms of risk. And some of the ones to avoid would be any pair with a ATR above 20 up between 20 and 30 and higher that those are the types of pairs you don't want to be trading if you have a tiny account and you have like a $100 account, you're a brand new trader. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to end up blowing that account if you consistently try to trade those highly volatile markets, especially if you don't know what you're doing yet. And as a beginner, I didn't know what I was doing. So you probably fall under that category at the moment if you are a beginner trader, someone that's just starting out. So use that ATR indicator when you start to trade. If you have a small account and it will help you stay away from blowing your account, ultimately help you stay in the market longer, learn what you need to know and become a professional trader.
