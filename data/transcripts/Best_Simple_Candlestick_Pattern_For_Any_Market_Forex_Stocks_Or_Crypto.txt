This candlestick pattern formation will be one of the most simple candlestick patterns you have ever learned But do not knock it for being simple the reason this candlestick pattern works so well is one It gives you a consistent set of rules you can follow while trading when it comes to why you actually press that buy Your sell button to enter a trade and two it is an extremely logical pattern that shows you buying or selling pressure By looking for what is called close above and below candlestick patterns the first thing we'll take a look at is a bullish Example of this pattern this pattern consists of nothing more than the close above a previous high of a previous candle so if we have something like a downtrend happening and then we get a candlestick followed by a bullish candlestick that closes above the eye of that candlestick This is a clear logical sign that we have buying pressure
