Jay traders, Steven here from the trading channel. So the question is, am I psychic? Well the answer isn't astounding no guys, and the only reason that I titled this video that is because throughout the beginning of my trading career, when I saw someone that was a professional and a profitable trader and I saw them making winning trades constantly, I believed that somehow they knew exactly what was going to happen in the market. For some reason I believed that they knew how to predict the future of the market, and at the time that did not seem like an outlandish idea. At the time it seemed very plausible from the things that I saw them doing and the trades I saw them taking. But when you think about it in reality that's a pretty outlandish and crazy assumption. That was me assuming that they were psychic and could tell the future when the truth is none of us know what's going to happen in the market. And the reason I want to tell you guys that is because that was a real big turning point for my own personal trading. Because once you know that there's no way for you to predict exactly what's going to happen in the market 100% of the time, it puts you on the right path to understanding that your job and your ability to become a professional and profitable trader is going to land on your ability to give yourself an advantage over the market. Not to be right 100% of the time, but to give yourself an advantage as in when 60% of your trades at a one to one risk reward, that would be considered an advantage over the market. No one is able to tell the future of the market and no one knows exactly what the market is going to do. And the faster you understand that, the faster I understood that it led me to the right path of becoming profitable. So that's the way I wanted to start out this video guys. I wanted to make sure you understand that no one knows exactly what the market is going to do and that even when you become profitable and a professional trader, you're not going to know what the market is going to do. You're going to have an advantage over the market. So with that said, today we're going to be taking a look at the dollar yen and the dollar Swiss and we're going to be taking a look at the future trading possibilities of these two pairs. We're going to be taking a look at the major levels of structure when it comes to support and resistance and what I'll be paying attention to for future trading opportunities. Now speaking of psychic abilities, what I'm going to do is actually play you guys at clip from last week's structure based trading video where I pointed out the fact that we could see an advanced pattern way before this advanced pattern ever was possible. So let's go ahead and take a look at that clip and I'll be right back. That means that we could possibly see this market continue up to our next resistance level. So in preparation for that, we may be looking for long opportunities on this pair on lower timeframes. Currently, I don't see a way to get involved, but if we get some kind of entry, let's think very far ahead and say that we get maybe some type of advanced pattern from this level, then that could be a way to enter this market going along for advanced pattern traders and if on our. All right guys, welcome back. So here we are on the dollar yen for our chart and this is actually what gave me the idea of the title of this video. So if you look with me here, we were talking about possibly getting an advanced pattern set up at this level. If I drag my fibs up, you can see that we did get an advanced bat pattern for those of you that are familiar with the advanced bat pattern. I'm sure you already see this. We have a X to a leg and a retracement of at least 50% that does not touch 618. Then we have an A to B of at least 382. And then we have our decompletion at the 886. So ironically, we actually did get a bat pattern and advanced pattern entry here around that daily level of structure. They could possibly push this market back up at least to targets around the 382 retracement right in here. So that's something we've already taken a look at on the dollar yen. For now, let's go ahead and take a look at what we can see in the future for this pair. Go ahead and delete all the drawings here and we'll take a look at the higher timeframes. Go out to the daily chart and here on the daily chart, as we were just discussing, we are at a previous level of daily structure where we could see this market bounce off of and we do have a possibility of this market making it back up to this previous little resistance level here or even our next resistance level. But we could also see this market drop down below our 108.73 support level. So the idea here again, guys, is that we don't know exactly what the market is going to do, but in an attempt to get an advantage over the market, we can prepare for every situation. So with that said, the things we're going to be looking for here on the dollar yen is to see whether or not this market comes up from this 108.73 support level. If that does happen, if we do push up from this level with a pretty impulsive move, then we'll be waiting on the 112.02 level to be touched in order to wait for possible shorting opportunities. And if that level is broken, then we'll be waiting on the 114.18 level for our next possible shorting opportunities. And I really like that level because it's right up here at these two highest resistance levels that we can see on the chart now. If this market does decide to break through this 108.73 level, then we'll be waiting for the market to push all the way down to 106.79. We may look for some shorting opportunities in through this area. And once the market gets down to that area, then we'll be looking for our next counter trend long opportunities. So that's what we're looking for here on the dollar yen. Now we'll move along and go ahead and take a look at the dollar Swiss. All right, guys. So here we are on our next pair, the dollar Swiss. And last week we were discussing this red line here at 0.9763 as being our next level of resistance that the market could possibly touch, put in an entry reason and push down from possibly all the way to our 0.965 level, which was our little over 100 pip drop. And that's exactly what the market did. We came up and touched that level and then pushed all the way down to our next support. So what I'm going to do now is actually play you guys a clip from last week's video pointing this out and I'll be right back for this video, which is going to be the dollar Swiss. And here on the dollar Swiss, we have a pretty interesting situation setting up. We have this market coming up to test a major level of daily resistance. And that's always interesting. So let's go ahead and drop down to a lower timeframe at the moment. We are at a daily level resistance, meaning that we can look for a counter trend trading opportunity. This market has begun. All right, guys, as you saw from last week's video, we were pointing out this level of structure here and the market did fall from that level. But now what are we looking for here on the dollar Swiss? Well, we are floating around the 0.963 level. And if we look in the past, you can see that that is a level the market's respected a few different times as support already. We have a respected level here, here and here. And down here on the four-hour chart, we actually do have a double bottom formation that's already happened. We're a little late on this one, but as you can see, the market pushed down, created one bottom, a neckline, and then another bottom before pushing up. So that was a double bottom formation right around the daily level of structure. Now what else are we looking for out of the dollar Swiss? Let's go ahead and zoom back out of the daily chart. If the dollar Swiss does push back up, we'll be looking for a similar trade to last week. We'll be looking for another test of our 0.9763 level right in here for our next short trading opportunities. And if the market does go through current support level that we're floating around, we'll be looking for our next level of support at the 0.953 level for our next long opportunities. We managed to get above the 0.976 level of resistance, then we'll be looking for our next resistance at 0.984 in that zone. And reason being there is because we have a couple of different touches back in the past of that level of resistance. So those are our major structure levels for the dollar yen and for the dollar Swiss guys. And I hope this brought some value to your trading.
