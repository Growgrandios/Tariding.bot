Hey everyone, Steven here from the Trading Channel. And first off I'd just like to apologize. It's been about two weeks now since I've put out my last video. I went on vacation and I chose not to take my computer with me, just to keep from being distracted to try to relax a little better. But now I'm back and ready to shoot some more educational content for you. In today's video I'm going to be showing you a little bit about target taking and the different ways that you can go about placing targets while back testing, advanced patterns and other strategies in the market. And also as usual I'll be sharing with you all the trades that I've taken in the past couple of weeks before I went on vacation. And also a few trades that I've taken since being back. And as usual I'll let you take a look at the equity curve to see how my strategy has played out since beginning my YouTube channel. So go ahead and click that like button for me. If you're new then go ahead and subscribe to my channel for more free educational content. I'm going to let the intro and disclaimer roll. And as soon as I get back I'll explain to you why I'm in the trade that you see on the chart in front of you. So I'll let the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll be right back. Alright everyone so as you can see I'm short here on the Dollar Canada because of a cipher pattern that completed. And the reason I wanted to share this with you guys is because I've seen a lot of traders that back test a system and get good results on their back testing and then they get into live markets and they wonder why they're not getting similar results to their back testing. Results. Say a trader back tests only the cipher pattern and figures out that on a certain pair and a certain time frame the cipher pattern is 70% accurate and produces 20 or 30% a year. I'm just making an example. So when he gets in the live market and starts trading the cipher pattern after 3 or 4 months he realizes that the cipher pattern he's trading in the live markets is only 50% accurate and he's actually losing money after 3 or 4 months. Now a majority of the time the reason for this is because this trader is making excuses why they are not in good trades or why they are in bad trades. I'll say that again. Majority of the time the reason traders are having this problem is because they are making excuses why they are not in good trades and why they are in bad trades. An example of that is here on the chart. A trader may have tested the cipher pattern and gone through and tested 100 trades of the cipher pattern on a certain pair and a certain time frame and came up with a profitable strategy he can use in his live trading account. He came up with a profitable strategy that has a drawdown that he's comfortable dealing with and then he gets into live markets and emotions take over. Emotions like I'm sure would take over in a situation that you see on your chart. The situation being yes we have a cipher pattern that's completing right here. But what do we have right before this cipher pattern completion? If I delete the cipher pattern on the chart it makes it a little more clear to see. We have a breakout of a descending channel right here. So what I'm telling you is a majority of the traders that get inconsistent results on their live trading account than they had with their back testing that kind of inconsistency happens because mistakes like this. Because right here this specific trader that is having inconsistent results compared to his back testing right here he's probably saying yeah that's a cipher pattern completion but we just broke out of this descending channel and I don't want to place that trade. I don't want to get short on the dollar cad when it's just broke out of a descending channel. That normally means price action is going to go higher and I'm not comfortable doing that. But now they back tested this strategy and if it is then that's fine to trade that way. But majority of people do not back test the cipher pattern and while back testing never take the trades that have just broke out of a descending channel. That's just not normally on someone's mind while they're back testing the strategy. They're looking for winners and losers. Sorry about that rant guys but I just see so many traders that could be successful but they lack the discipline. They lack the self control which is the hard part. The easy part is back testing these strategies having the self control to perform them in the live markets every day and risk your real money. That's the hard part to deal with and I hope that by explaining all this maybe it helps someone that's in that situation that's watching this video and just know that the only reason I'm able to explain this in such good detail and show you this example on the chart today is because I've made the same mistake in the past. It's absolutely normal to make these kind of mistakes when you're a beginner and even if you're a little further along in your trading career this kind of mistake is normal to a certain degree. You just have to find a way to get past it. So now we'll take a look at some of the trades that I've been in over the past couple of weeks and later on I'll also be showing you an example of my equity curve since starting my YouTube channel. So let's head over to some other charts and check out those trades. Okay guys so normally I show you all of the trades that I've taken throughout a certain week in order to come up with the profits or losses that I had on my equity curve but since it's been a couple of weeks since I came out with a video there's actually close to 30 trades and that would just be way too long of a YouTube video. So I'm just going to point out some of the ones that I think would be most educational for you and then I'm going to show you the equity curve and show you how those trades played out on the equity curve. And also I wanted to point out that showing you the equity curve is not to show you how many pips I made throughout the past few months I've had this channel open. That's not the case at all. I'm actually way more interested in not losing money than I am making money so that would be counterproductive. The reason that I share an equity curve with you guys is because I know for a fact that eventually I'm going to hit a big drawdown. I normally have a drawdown about once every two or three months and they can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. So I want to be able to share that with you guys when it comes so that you can be more comfortable when you hit your drawdown because I know that drawdowns are always very hard to get through especially because there's so much stuff out there on YouTube and other trading websites that tell you you can be rich overnight without ever having to suffer losses. And I just am a firm believer that that's not the case because I've tried it and it didn't work at all. I'm going to be doing a video on risk management later on this week. So if that's something you're interested in then don't forget to subscribe to my channel so that you're alerted when that video comes out and for the guys and gals that are already subscribed keep your eye out for that one. Alright so here on the Eurodollar as you can see there has been nothing but a mess. Breaks of previous resistance, breaks of previous supports and no real direction of the market. And the reason I'm showing you guys this specific pair is because even as ugly as this chart looks this was our most profitable pair in the past two weeks. To an untrained eye this just looks like junk and consolidation but once you learn to understand advanced patterns and structure you can really use those two things to your advantage when the market does things like this. The first trade that we had on the Eurodollar was a cipher pattern. Let me lighten this up a bit to make it easier to see. The first trade here was a cipher pattern and it came from here down x to a, a to b, b to c and cd completion was right here and this one was a heartbreaker. This one hit our entry here and came down got within about a pip away from our profit target right here on this green candle wick coming down and then reversed we had our stop loss at break even and we were stopped out of this trade for break even. The second trade we had on the Eurodollar was right here it was a cipher pattern coming in in blue here and it ended somewhere down here. We hit targets on this trade and next wouldn't you know it another cipher pattern came in x to a, a to b, b to c and c to d right up there. Now as you can see three ciphers in a row two wins one loss. Can anyone guess what we had next? I'm running out of colors. Let me use purple. Next we have another cipher pattern x to a, a to b, b to c, c to d completion right here also running up the hit target and here we are one, two, three, four cipher patterns in a row three wins one loss. If you're interested in seeing how this amazing pattern works then I have a video tutorial on how to identify the cipher pattern and if that's something you're interested in I'll put a link in the bottom left and you can go over there and check that video out and learn how to back test and trade this strategy for yourself. Next up here on the Eurodollar what did we do? We broke structure to the upside. For those of you that have seen my 786 strategy video you know what I do whenever this happens and for those of you that haven't again I'll put a link in the bottom right hand side of your screen to a video tutorial I have on a strategy that I use called the 786 strategy. There's the breaking close above structure. I took a Fibonacci retracement from swing low up to swing high. We purchased the 786 right here with targets up at previous structure. We've worked with stop losses down here right below our previous low. Setting us up with a pretty good risk to reward a little better than a 2 to 1 and as you can see we did come up to hit targets. Now as we hit targets does anyone notice anything right here as we hit targets? Something about this here impulse leg, this retracement, this extension, if you guessed cypher pattern you are absolutely correct. Again we hit another cypher pattern here. Next to A, A to B, B to C and a CD completion right down here. I cannot remember if this was a win or a loss let me bring in my Fibonacci retracement. This one was a win as you can see coming up to our 382 retracement here and taking us out on profit targets. And we're not done yet. As you can see here another breaking close below a major structure level here and as I referred to earlier the 786 strategy that I use breaking close below structure Fibonacci retracement from this swing high down to the swing low looking for the 786 retracement. As you can see got it right there. Now we take stops above previous structure right here and targets down at previous support. So that green for targets as you can see again a better than 2 to 1 risk reward. And that's the trades we were able to produce on the euro dollar in the past couple of weeks so far. As you can see a lot of advanced patterns a couple of really good structure trades and one small loss. And the next pair I want to look at is the Dollar Canada and this will be the last pair we look at but I actually wanted to show you guys a loss because this is an example of a good trade that ended up ending as a loss. Here on the Dollar Canada we had a cipher pattern completion. By bringing my Fibonacci retracement you see that we got a retracement here that hit 382 but did not close below 618 so we know that that's a valid B leg and then we'll drag that the rest of the way up and bring on our extension tool from X to A back down in. You see that our red line here the 127 extension was hit so that validates our C leg. Now all we wait for is a 786 retracement to complete the pattern so if I draw that in here it looked a little something like this here and D right here. And as you can see this pattern was blown out of the water. We took a significant loss on this trade something like 110, 120 pips in between there and this is just an example of a good trade that ended up losing. The pattern fits into my rules for a cipher pattern so on completion I had a limit order but it just didn't work out and sometimes that's going to be the case. There's a reason that patterns are only 50, 60, 70 percent profitable. It's because 20, 30 and 40 percent of the time they lose. You are going to have losses that's why risk management is so important. Keep that in mind. So before we get over to taking a look at the equity curve I just wanted to show you guys the trade that we looked at at the very beginning of this video on the Dollar Canada. The one that I was explaining that most traders that are less disciplined and most traders that have inconsistent results in live trading compared to their backtesting trading wouldn't take this kind of trade is now well into profit and I'm not saying that it's going to win because crazier things have happened than something getting within 20 pips of a profit and turning around and stopping me out. But as you can see we're well on our way to profits on this particular trade and this would be profits if it does hit targets that that kind of trader would miss out on. Alright so now let's go over to the equity curve and I will explain in detail the ups and downs of that equity curve and what you should expect from your own equity curve when trading in the markets. Alright guys so here's a spreadsheet showing our equity curve since starting my YouTube channel. And as you can see at the top here I have the numbers the wins the losses the winning percentage the pips the average loss average win and the average risk to reward. If you're interested in learning how I set up my spreadsheets for backtesting forward testing and for live trading then leave me some comments below this video and if I get enough comments I will do a video explaining how I set up all those spreadsheets. As you can see here on this spreadsheet we have been trading now since 1116 which was the beginning of my channel and today's date is 131 a little over 3 months that we've been trading and over that course of time we have won 40 trades, lost 23 trades giving us a win percentage of 63% we've been able to accumulate 1400 and 2 pips our average loss is 94 dollars our average win is 124 dollars and our average risk to reward is 1.32 meaning every time we lose a pip we normally win 1.3 pips and if we take a look here at the equity curve you will see that we started at 0 we dropped a little and then ever since then it's really been a slow and steady climb up to that 1400 and 2 pips that we're sitting at right now and this is not a normal equity curve for me it has been 3 months since starting my channel and I fully expect this equity curve to take a drop down closer to 1000 here before going back up I normally have a pretty big drawdown about once every 3 months and I haven't hit one yet so I'm completely expecting to hit a drawdown and I'm actually kind of excited to be able to show that to you guys not that I'm excited about losing money there's absolutely nothing excited about losing money but at least it will be a good example to you guys on how an equity curve actually looks it's not always this slow and steady climb more often than not it's a slow steady climb than a decline slow steady climb a little bit higher than a decline slow steady climb and then a decline the real goal of the equity curve is for your drawdowns to start coming in at a higher level so if we started out at 0 and our drawdown went to minus 200 then we would want to get high enough on our equity curve to where our next drawdown did not break below our zero point next we would want to get high enough on our equity curve to where our next drawdown did not break below 250 pips and so on and so forth get up here towards 1000 and 1500 you want to try to make sure your drawdown doesn't get under 1000 pips and as you can see on the left side here all the numbers in red are our losses all the numbers in black are winds the total amount of pips that we've gained is over here in G so that's a look at my equity curve up to January the 26th I hope this helps you guys out and inspires you to start keeping track of your own trading a little better because all of this analysis and all of these statistics really help you out while you're going through drawdowns and it really helps you to determine what strategies you want to use to keep to take away from your overall trading strategy it's just a really good thing to be keeping track of all of your trades like this. Alright so that's going to be it for today's video I hope that helped some of you out on your journey to becoming a successful trader and if you enjoyed the content in this video don't forget to hit that like button for me also if this is your first time viewing one of my videos don't forget to subscribe to be alerted when I come out with new content and if you're interested in seeing more videos like this then check out my channel for more free educational content best of luck to you on all your future trades and I'll see you next time.
