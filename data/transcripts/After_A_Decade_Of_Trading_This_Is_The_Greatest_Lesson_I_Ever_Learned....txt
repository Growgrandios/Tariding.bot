A majority of your trading success will actually come down to what happens in the six inches between your ears, your mindset, your trading psychology, and your ability to manage and handle the risks that are involved in trading. Don't get me wrong, a strategy that's profitable, easy to follow, and it makes money over time is absolutely a huge part of you being a successful trader, but again, your trading success depends on much more than that. And in just a moment, I want to go through some tips and tricks that I use to have a good trading mindset and to control risk. But first, let me explain this. Trading is gambling if you do not have a full tested and proven to be profitable trading plan that you consistently follow. If you do not have that, then when you're trading, you are gambling. You need a statistic advantage that is proven to be profitable in historic data so that you know it as the likelihood of being profitable in the future. And that's not all you need. It's not just the strategy. You need a full plan. You need that along with a risk management plan that keeps you emotionless while trading because you will have some losses and you need the discipline and trading psychology to stick to those two things without switching strategies, moving stop losses, risking more on some trades than you do others. Things of that nature would all be signs that you're not ready to trade live. So right now, if you are trading live without a full plan, not just a strategy, then that would be equivalent to going to Vegas and just spending your money. You want to be more like the person that's counting cards in Vegas. If you don't know why counting cards works, it's because when counting cards play magic, you have a statistic advantage over the casino, a small one, but it is an advantage that plays out over time, which is why counting cards is so frowned upon in Las Vegas because the casino wants to make money. The markets want to take your money. And so without a full tested statistical probability of success, which is our trading plan or strategy, our risk management, our trading psychology, without that, you are just gambling. You're just going to the casino and playing games. And the really bad thing is you probably would not take your life savings, go to Vegas and just gamble. But for some reason, even well before traders create a trading plan that has a statistic probability of giving them an edge over time, way before that, they're okay putting their life savings into a trading account. My friend, that is nothing more than gambling and that is equivalent to taking your life savings to Vegas and gambling it away. And that's exactly what will happen in the markets if you don't take control of your trading. So with that being the case, let me explain a few different ways that I personally manage risk and some things I use to master my mindset when it comes to trading. Your ability to manage your risk in trades and overall is going to play a huge part in the emotions you have while you are trading. So the first thing we're going to discuss is risk management and the three tiers I have of creating a solid risk management plan. So let's get started. Risk management for me and my trading consists of three different parts. The first part is risk tolerance. Risk tolerance refers to the amount of money you put into an account for speculative trading. So this would be the overall amount of your net worth that you are willing to lose in terms of speculative trading because no matter how good you are at trading, weird events can happen where you lose your whole account. So what you don't want is to put your life savings or the money you need for your power bill next month, like I did at the beginning of my trading career, you don't want to put that money into a trading account. You want the amount of money you have in a trading account at the beginning when you're not profitable and don't have a trading plan or whatever it is or when you're just starting out, you want that amount of money to be an amount that you are okay losing and that is considered your risk tolerance overall. Next up, we have risk per trade. This is an amount of money that you are willing to lose on each individual trade you place because there's a chance that we lose that trade. So what you need to do is ensure that the loss you have when you do inevitably have losses, those losses are an amount of money that you are comfortable losing. If you are uncomfortable losing the amount of risk you have on a particular trade, you will make emotional mistakes while in that trade. You'll move your stop loss because you don't want to lose any money. So you'll just, oh, I'll just wait for it to go back up. Surely it will and then it'll keep going. You'll lose way more than you're supposed to. A lot of you may have experienced that. I know I have, which is why this rule is inside of my risk management plan. So this risk per trade needs to be a specific number. I personally use a percentage basis on my account value. I never risk most of the time I don't risk depending on the account. I have small accounts where I'll just risk crazy amount, but on my like normal account that I trade on a daily basis, I never risk more than 2% and at times I go as low as 1% of my total account value. That number is just what I am comfortable with and what you need to determine for your risk management plan is a number that you are comfortable with. It can either be a dollar amount specifically or a percentage of your total account value. The next thing we have is overall risk exposure. The sound semi complicated, but in reality, this just means how many trades can I be in it once? So for me, the way I measure this is if I'm risking 2% per trade, I can never be in more than five trades at once because what I don't want to happen is a crazy event that causes me to lose 5, 6, 7, 10 trades and then I lose 20% of my account in one day. That would be insane and something I do not want to experience. So for that reason, overall risk exposure is inside of my risk management plan and my overall risk exposure is 4-5 trades depending on the end percent of my account. I'm risking per trade because I may be risking 1% on a certain trade, 2% on another one, but my overall risk exposure is between 8% and 10%. And so thinking about these three things on a personal level in order to determine what you are actually comfortable with is your next step and then make rules for these. Risk tolerance, by the way, is also referred to as risk capital. I don't have to spell that capital. You know what I'm saying. It's also referred to as risk capital. I just call it risk tolerance. But these are the three things that I think should be in anyone's risk management plan. So go ahead and get started building a risk management plan based on what you are comfortable with in all three of these sections. The next thing we're going to talk about is trading psychology. This refers to your ability to stay disciplined to your trading plan and keep from switching strategies, switching risk based on fear and greed. I said grid. So essentially this is keeping you emotionless. So how do we become emotionless in our trading? Will we apply the correct risk management plan and then we apply these things as well. The first thing that helps the most with trading psychology is the most hated thing in trading. I do believe, which is backtesting. This is a very time consuming process. But what it allows you to do is see the exact strategy you are using perform through a historical data. You get to see the highs and the lows. You get to see the drawdowns and the massive amounts of profit that that strategy makes. And what that does is it makes you a bit more confident that you can handle drawdowns because in the backtesting process, you've seen that specific strategy go through different draw downs. Go through a period of time when it lost five trades in a row, but then you saw, oh, well, over a long span of time, it still made money, even though it did lose those five trades in a row. It gives you more confidence, which is another word for trading psychology is the how much confidence do you have in your trading strategy and in your full plan. This backtesting process will just improve that confidence. Next up, we have demo trading, which I know is not like live trading, but I am not talking about demo trading in the way most people do. When most people demo trade, they're demo, demo trading a random, they're gambling like we were talking about earlier. They're not demo trading based on a very specific strategy based on a very specific risk management plan and using good trading psychology because they're demo trading. They don't care about the account. Well, when you're demo trading to increase believability in your strategy, to increase confidence and to improve your trading psychology, you're actually going to be demo trading your exact trading plan before you go live. I normally suggest students do this for like three months. Just take your exact trading plan you've built through your process of backtesting, optimizing, creating your risk management plan. After that, take that plan and demo trade it for three months. Look, you have all the time in the world to make money from trading. These three months will build your confidence and improve your trading psychology by you seeing the strategy you're using work in real time. Go through drawdowns and come out profitable in real time. So demo trading is the second way, the second best way, I think to improve trading psychology. And this might honestly be the first way, but obviously risk management plays a huge part in your emotions and in your trading psychology. So we already discussed that in the previous section, but risk management is going to be a main contributor to your ability to master the six inches between your ears, your trading mindset. So once you have a rules based strategy, you can follow that you've back tested an optimize. You've created a trading plan around it by creating a risk management plan, working on your trading psychology and you've demo traded it for 90 days and seen it go in and out of drawdowns throughout backtesting and demo trading and your trading live with an amount of money you're willing to lose and by trading a risk per trade, you're willing to accept while also having an overall risk exposure. You accept you would be amazed at how much that improves your trading psychology. You will no longer be wanting to switch strategies. You will no longer move your stop loss up and down. Your mindset will be extremely solid if you complete those tasks. And look, completing those tasks alone can be a bit difficult, which is why we created the TTC Forex University. We currently have some space available in the university. So if you would like to get a mentorship program where I kind of hold your hand through the process of doing all of this, then it would be a pleasure to have you aboard inside of the university. If you want to do it, click the top link in the description or go to www.ttcfxuniversity.com to learn more about that. The university includes obviously a full course teaching you how to do everything we've talked about in this video, along with more strategies that I use. You also receive the Pro Trader Report every Monday, which is areas of structure. I'm paying attention to do for possible trades. It comes with two to five email analysis trades. These are trades I'm actually placing that you have learned inside of the university. They come equipped with entry stops and targets. They're not meant as signals. That's just to show you how the strategies you're learning inside the course are performing in real markets. But I digress. It comes with a lot of stuff.
