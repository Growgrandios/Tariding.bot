Hey traders, Stephen here. And this video is going to be the first of a series that I'll be recording and posting every week. In this series I'll be showing you the trades that I've taken throughout the week, the reason behind why I took those trades, and also a preview into some trades that I'm looking at going into next week. So I'll let the intro and disclaimer roll, sit back, relax, grab a cup of coffee, and enjoy. Alright, so just to give you an overview of how the week's been so far, it's Thursday, November 18th, and so far this week we've placed seven trades and produced nearly 100 pips of profit, 96 pips to be exact. But throughout this video I'll show you exactly how we produced that 96 pips. The first pair we'll look at is the dollar cad. The dollar cad gave us two different trading opportunities this week. The first came in way of a trend continuation trade, and the second was an advanced pattern called the Cypher pattern. And I'll show you both of those now. So I came into the market this week, and the first thing I noticed on the dollar cad was this break of the previous structure highs right here. When I get a break above, close above, the previous structure highs, my mind immediately goes to trend continuation. So now that I know that I'm thinking trend continuation, what I'm waiting for is some type of pullback, because this market is going to do one of two things. It's either going to come up, break through these previous structure highs right here, and just continue up on a rampage. Or it's going to come up, break through the structure highs, and pull back into one of these previous levels, whether it be this resistance level, this resistance level, this resistance level, or all the way down to this previous support. So that's what I'm looking for in a trend continuation trade. Well now that we have this break above, close above, my next step is to figure out where I want to enter the market. And for me, I want at least a one and a half to one for every trend continuation trade that I take, because my winning percentage on trend continuation trade is about 50 to 55%, so I always have to have better than a one to one. So now what you can do is take a box from the body of these candles on the swing high that we broke through and place that box from those swing highs down to the most previous swing lows. The support that we rallied out of. Now with this box drawn in, as you can see, if we enter the market at the top of this box at the top area around here, we're not going to have anywhere near a one to one. So that's okay. All you do is take the box and shrink it down to a position where you can get at least a one to one out of it. In this case, I actually brought the box all the way down to these previous resistance levels right here to give myself better than a one to one risk reward on this trade. So now we have our area that we're looking to buy. In this box here, all we need is a reason for entry. And for me, my reason for entry was these long candle wicks that you see right here. You see these one, two, three, four, five times we tested this area and were rejected. It gives me a clue that right in here is an area that the market may turn around and head back up in trend continuation. After seeing these wicks, I actually waited for a retest of the same support area. And I told myself, if we come back down into the same area here and the market sees support again, then I will buy the market. And what did we do rallied up here? Pulled back down into the same support area. We found support and I actually bought the market right here on this doji candle. And I had a risk reward set up that looked something like this. And this more than meets my risk reward rules. So I knew I was okay to buy the market right here on this doji candle. Well, once I did that, after I had already bought the market, I realized that we had just set up an advanced pattern called the cipher pattern. And the way it looks is X right here, X to A, A to B retracement, B to C extension, and C to D completion right in this area. I'll draw on a Fibonacci to see if I was close with that D leg. It looks like I was a little bit high. So CD completion right here at the 786 for a cipher pattern. Well the way I trade cipher patterns is I just put a limit order right at the D leg with targets down at a 382 retracement and a stop loss above X. And I know from my back testing and time in the market that if I trade the cipher pattern exactly like this with my targets at 382 and my stops right above X. And if I trade it on the same pairs that I tested, over time this will produce something between a 70 and 80% win rate. So knowing that the market has a 70 to 80% chance of turning around at my D leg of my cipher pattern right here, I decided to take profits from my trend continuation trade right here at the D leg of the cipher pattern and stop and reverse my orders from being a buyer from down here to a seller right here to going short at the D leg of this cipher pattern. And this is how those trades played out guys. I think together we bagged about 78 pips on this one pair this week. And guys if you're a beginning trader or even an experienced trader that's having trouble being consistently profitable and you're interested in learning how to read the markets like this and how to not be nervous when placing trades because guys I'm going to be honest with you. I was not nervous at all when I placed either of these trades and it's not because I knew they were both going to be winners. It's because I have hundreds of hours in the market testing these strategies. In real time trading these strategies and I know that if I consistently place trades like this and follow all of my rules while placing these trades that I will be profitable. I may not be profitable every day. I may not be profitable every week but throughout the course of a quarter, throughout the course of a year over the long run I will be profitable if I trade consistently and stick to my plan. And if that's something you're interested in being able to do then please just go ahead and subscribe to this channel because I'm going to be doing tutorials on all of my strategies. I'll be doing tutorials on advanced patterns, tutorials on how to read a price chart and tutorials on all of the structure trades that I use in my strategies. My whole goal is to try to reach out to any struggling trader and help them become consistently profitable. And this is not the only way to do it but this is the way that I've found works best for me and hopefully it will work for you as well. But anyway, moving on to the next pair, we'll take a look at the pound dollar which gave us a very nice cipher pattern as well here. And it came in like X to A, A to B, B to C and CD completion somewhere around that area, C, how correct I am, should be at the 786, a little bit high, CD completion right there. Profits got taken off at a 382 retracement and this particular pattern was a 32-pip winner. Coming in like so. My ruler. Yep, 32-pips. Next up, we're going to take a look at one of the patterns that actually lost this week and that came on the dollar Swiss. Sorry guys, I got limit orders in all over the place for these other patterns that are happening. But anyway, here was the bat pattern that took away some of our profit. It comes in like X to A, A to B above the 50% retracement, B to C did not break through A and CD completion at the 886 retracement. Stops were about 20-pips above X on this particular trade and we were stopped out over here. I didn't get targets but I was actually slipped on this trade. Yep, we got pretty close and I got slipped on it so nothing you can do, that's going to happen. Next up, let's take a look at the Aussie CAD which also produced a cipher pattern for us this week looking like X to A, A to B, B to C, CD completion somewhere in that area. This pattern produced 21-pips in profit. Next we'll look at the pound Swiss which had a losing bat pattern as well. Zoom in here, make it a little easier to see. This bat pattern came in X to A, A to B, B to C, CD completion around the 886 and as you can see we didn't even get close to targets here. I'll go ahead and draw in the 382 retracement and this one just blew us right out of the water hitting stops before it even came close to targets at the 382 retracement. The last pair we'll look at today is going to be the dollar yen. The dollar yen had a cipher pattern earlier today. It comes in like X to A, A to B, B to C and a CD completion right in there and it came up to hit targets for about 25 pips. As you can see we went past our 382 retracement and hit targets for 25 pips. Now I'll go through the charts and show you a couple of things that I'm looking at going into next week. So the first pair that we're going to look at going into next week is the euro dollar. As you can see I'm already short the euro dollar but I think that this would be a good trade even if the market comes up a little higher as long as we don't break above these last previous structure highs then this is still a good trading opportunity in my opinion. So I wanted to give you guys a look at it just in case your trading plan allows you to take a trade similar to this one. So the reason I sold the market here is because it gave me a nice one to one risk reward and also it lined up perfect with a 618 Fibonacci retracement and this is actually a trading strategy that I use and that I will be teaching in a later video. As you can see the euro dollar has been putting in lower highs, breaking structure to the downside, more lower highs, breaking structure to the downside and more lower highs. So this leads me to believe that this market will continue in the downward direction. Next up we'll take a look at the pound dollar. Here on the pound dollar we actually have an advanced pattern setting up and you may already see this if you're a more advanced trader but just in case I'll draw in the Fibonacci's and bring in my triangle tool we have X to A, A to B coming above the 50% retracement here, B to C and CD completion at the 886. So I'll have limit order setting here at the 886 with a profit target at the 382 and stop losses just above X. The euro pound also has a structure trade that I'm looking at going to the next week. We have been creating lower lows and lower highs on this pair as well but we've come down here to this level and created kind of a triple bottom here and also if we look left we'll see that this is a place the market has found support before a few times. Here's one time then it found resistance here then it found support again then it found resistance again so we know that this is a place where the market makes decisions and considering what we see on the chart here what do you think that decision may be. My thought after putting in all these long candle wicks again here at this area and this small rally we've gotten out of this area before is that we could see something like this out of this area and that's what I would be waiting on. I don't want to buy yet because I'm not sure if this level is going to hold but if we break above these structure highs and then pull back into them into these structure highs or even a little lower that's when I would be interested in buying the market and anticipation for at least a retest of these previous highs and that would give you a risk reward that would look something like this. And this looks pretty good to me and it may not do this we're a long ways away this market could continue straight down like this but we're trying to think ahead of the market and that's why we're drawing all of this out. And lastly we'll look at the Aussie CAD. Here we have an advanced pattern that's already in progress and this is not what I'm looking at going into next week. What I'm looking at going into next week is going to be a trend continuation trade coming back down into this structure level right here and this is going to set me up with a really nice risk reward if we get back down here. Should look something like this. I may wait until it comes a little bit lower just to give myself a little bit of risk reward on this trade. And something like that's what I'm looking at going into next week. We've just recently broke above these structure highs right here and came up to test this previous resistance level which is where my back pattern entry was earlier which we're down $50 on right now but we came up to this previous resistance level. We're looking for a retracement back down in to this previous, anywhere between these previous resistance levels and this previous support. If we get down there then we're going to expect the market to at least come up and retest this resistance level right here. And that will bring us another decent trading opportunity next week.
