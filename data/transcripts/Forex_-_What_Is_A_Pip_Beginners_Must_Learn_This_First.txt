Hey traders today, you're gonna learn about a pip you're gonna learn what a pip is and how to actually read the evaluation of a currency pair based on a Pip also there's a couple of different ways that a pip is calculated depending on the pair that you're trading So today I'm gonna wipe out any confusion you have about what a pip is on each currency pair And I'm gonna do that right now So if this is something you're struggling with make sure to watch this entire video and before I let the intro disclaimer roll Go ahead and click that subscribe button down below the video to the right hand side Click that like button to help with the YouTube algorithm and follow us on Instagram at the trading channel If you're interested in learning more about forex I will see you on the other side of the intro and disclaimer to talk about exactly what a pip is see in a second Next up in the all-inclusive beginner forex trading course is what is a pip We have to understand what a pip is because this a pip is how the forex market moves a pip is the smallest amount of movement we can see in a currency pair that actually matters to us whenever we're placing orders a Pip is how we make profit or get stopped out depending on how our trade goes So it's very important that we understand what this is again a pip is the smallest number that moves in a currency That we care about as traders There's one number below this called a fractional pip that we're not even gonna talk about other than me saying Don't pay attention to it because it does not matter at all to us as traders So what is a pip? We know that a pip is the smallest number that moves in a currency pair But how do we identify a pip? Well look at the euro dollar right now right now? You can see the euro dollar last price is 107 8 7 1.07 8 7 so let's write that down We have the euro dollar At a price of 107 8 7 1.07 8 7 and you can see on that currency as well that there is a Smaller number as a fifth decimal a smaller number that's two right now in red. That's a fractional pip We're not gonna worry about those at all what you need to understand is that the way you identify a pip is the fourth Place away from the decimal so the fourth decimal point meaning if this is the decimal point we count over one two three four this is a pip and Let me clarify that really quickly right now We are talking about a pip on every currency pair except currency pairs that end in JPY Any currency pair with JPY in it is going to be slightly different than this and we're gonna go over that next So this is going to be what is a pip and I'm gonna put non JPY here so that no one's confused This is a pip on every currency pair except yin pairs which we're gonna discuss what a pip is in a yin pair And just a second but for every other currency this is what you're gonna use so this is what is a pip? non JPY For every currency pair that doesn't have JPY in it the fourth decimal place is what is known as one pip So we have the euro dollar to value of 1.0787 What if the euro dollar goes to 1.0786? How much have we dropped the euro dollars went down now, but by how much? Well the math here is pretty easy if we went from 7 to 6 on our fourth decimal Which is a pip we dropped by one pip and here's how I want you to look at this This is the way I looked at it at the beginning and it really helped me to Understand this a little more clearly not that it's a super complicated thing Understanding this if you watch this video a couple times will be extremely easy But the way I look at this is let's write out our Value of the euro dollar and space it out a little bit to give us a little bit of room And that's what I'm really trying to do here. I want to give myself a little bit of room so we have a one decimal zero seven eight seven right So with this being the case the way I look at this if I if I count my numbers one two three fourth decimal places a PIP I like to look at it like this. This is our ones meaning every time this moves It's gonna be one this is our tens every time an eight goes up or down in this specific case That's gonna be tens and this is our 100s that makes it so easy to say okay If the euro dollar went from 1.07 Eight seven what it's at right now to 1.07 Nine seven how much did we move well? Let's look down here at our chart where that's the tens that column is the tens that decimal point number three is the tens So therefore this went down and actually in this case since we went up from eight to nine Hopefully you caught that before I did then obviously that means that the euro dollar went up Ten Pips because it was in our third decimal point now Let's do one more number to make sure you understand this and we'll go through one more currency pair to really make sure you have a good grasp On this this is the foundation of any trading career. So let's do one point oh eight eight seven can you tell me at this point how many Pips did the euro dollar rise? Well, let's look at our column or graph. We have our ones the seven it stayed the same We have our tens which was eight it stayed the same we have our one hundreds that was seven and is now eight That means that the euro dollar went up not by ten but by one hundred Pips So that's the way you recognize a Pip a pip is the fourth decimal place is the smallest amount of currency moves that we care about as traders Let's do a completely different currency pair that is not a yen pair and go over one more and again Just like in the last lesson. I'm gonna ask you a lot of questions that we go through this I'm gonna ask you a lot of questions as we go through this and I want you to actually answer those questions on the other end where you're sitting or standing depending on whether or not you're trying to get exercise in and Now what we're gonna do again is go over a different currency pair. Let's go over the Aussie New Zealand Let's just pick a random pair. So a u d NZ d I Do my ends back. I'm slightly dyslexic. I literally just drew an in backwards because I cannot Ever remember which way they go and in my head. It's always backwards. So we have the Aussie New Zealand, right? The Aussie New Zealand has a current value of 1.0248 1.0248 Tell me what would be the case, okay? Let's go over a scenario if the Aussie New Zealand went from 1.0248 to 1.0348 How many pips did this currency pair move? I'll give you a second Hopefully you were able to say 100 pips. Let's draw out our table one more time to make this very easy 1 decimal 0248, okay? Here we have our little table that I'd like to make at this point We have our ones are one pit which is the fourth decimal our tens, which is the third decimal We'll write this out to one two three four decimals We have our 100s and the zero would be the 1000s. You don't really have to know that That's kind of irrelevant unless we have some kind of super crazy market moves But in this case of the Aussie New Zealand from 1.0248 to 1.0348 Which currency with excuse me which Stop my phone here. Which one of these numbers changed? It wasn't our ones at all was it or ones wasn't eight. It's still an eight It wasn't our tens. It was a four. It's still a four was it our 100s. It was a two. It is a three So therefore this market moved 100 pips going from two to three would mean that we moved a total of 100 pips here on the Aussie New Zealand So in order to be absolutely sure that you understand all this give yourself a little test Look at a currency pair and look at all the numbers on that pair's value and then ask yourself What would change right down another random number below or above it? And what would change if price went from where it is now to that number that you wrote down? That's a great exercise to do here in this case and remember the way we're looking at this is our Pip our one pip is the fourth decimal place away from the decimal. Okay, so if we have our Just as a final review here on non-yen pairs if we have The fourth decimal place here. This would be four right one two three four after the decimal This is one pip. This is the tens This is the 100s. So if we move to 1.0 2 5 8 then we have moved up 10 pips. That's how you need to be looking at it In terms of what a pip is and how it's valued now We've just talked about every non-yen pair any pair that does not have JPY will be calculated like this and will be Valuated like this with four decimal places now what about yen pairs something very slight? Changes on any pair with a letter JPY attached to it. So let's do an example of that right now if we look at the value right now of the dollar yen, which is USD JPY The dollar yen currently has a value of one ten point nine oh with This being the case and own only pairs with JPY attached to them We go to decimal places instead of four. What do I mean by that? Let's actually draw the graph right now so that we can make this as easy as possible. We have one one oh point nine oh Okay, if we draw our same graph, this is what it looks like now now our one pip is the second decimal place So what do we have to do we see our decimal right there? We go one two on the second decimal place is one pip. So this is our ones What does that mean for the nine in this specific case? That means the nine is going to be our tens and the zero is going to be our one hundredths, okay? So with this in place, let's go ahead and ask ourselves a very familiar question for this video, which is If this market moved from one ten point nine oh to one ten Point nine six how many pips did it go up? If the market moved this amount how many pips is that that this market just rose? Well, if we look at the ones it goes from zero to six therefore this market would have risen or rose Not sure which one to use there by six pips Let me turn this on silence. Sorry guys. Okay, so now let's go over a couple of other examples. So instead of Us rising by six pips. I want you to tell me how much we are rising in this case. Let's go with One one two point nine oh If price of the dollar yen Goes from one one oh point nine oh to one one two point nine oh then how much has that? Value risen how much does the price went up? This my friends would be two hundred pips because this column that was zero is the hundreds column So this would be a plus two hundred on the dollar yen now to make sure that you understand the in pairs as well As you do the other every other currency pair I'm gonna go over one more yen pair that doesn't have the dollar in it Just a completely different pair to make sure you're completely comprehending how to read pips Let's go ahead and do that right now and again in this section I'll be asking a lot of questions and I want you to try to answer them at home So that you get a better grasp of this before I answer them here even if you have to pause the video so Let's go That all rhymed Wow, that's pretty good. Let's go into another yen pair. Let's try out the pound yen. So G B's P JPY and The value of this currency pair right now if I find it in the chart and I'll show you a screenshot of it somewhere The value of the pound yen is 130.70 As You'll notice because this pair has JPY in it we only move two decimals from the decimal right? So if we have 130.70 Then decimal one would count is how many pips? This is our 10s remember and then this our second decimal right? This is decimal two is going to be one bit So if this market and this are zero on the 130 our zero is going to be 100 pips So if this market goes to one thirty three Seven oh, what do we have how much of a move did we have in the pound yen? We had a? 300 pip move a plus 300 pip move if we go from 130 point seven oh to one 30.85 How many pips did we move we moved up? 15 pips Because 70 to 85 is 15 if we go to 130 point 72 How many pips did we move up? Two pips and if we go from 130 point seven oh to one 29 point Seven oh how much did we go down? 100 pips we went down 100 pips So I hope that now you have a really good grasp of what a pip actually means and how to calculate a currency's value against another one This is a very important foundational step to beginning your foreign currency trading career So it's definitely necessary to have in the arsenal and up next we're gonna talk about what is the actual value for each Pip how to calculate order size and a little bit about leverage So I hope to see you there in the next video or I will see you there in the next video and I'll talk to you then see soon
