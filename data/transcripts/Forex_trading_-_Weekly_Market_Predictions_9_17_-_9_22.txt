What is up traders welcome to another episode of 4x weekly market predictions. We got some really exciting stuff to take a look at structurally for the rest of this week and today we're going to be looking at a couple of different pairs including the euro dollar and the Aussie dollar. We'll be talking about the key levels of structure that we hear at the trading channel will be paying attention to for trading opportunities throughout the rest of this week. I'm also going to give you guys a little blast from the past. We're going to take a look at last week's videos and the trading opportunities that we were taking a look at last week based on these structure levels and I'm going to talk you guys through those trading opportunities and how they played out. We had a couple of wins and a couple of losses from last week's predictions so we'll talk about each of those trades and also take a look at what we're looking at going forward on these pairs when it comes to key levels of structure.

While you do that I'm going to go ahead and let the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll see you guys on the other side. All right traders let's go ahead and get started with this week's video. In last week's video we were taking a look at a couple of different levels here on the euro dollar. Right now we're on the euro dollar four hour chart and in last week's predictions video we actually talked about our 1.2057 zone as being a possible shorting opportunity zone. As you can see the market pushed up into that zone and as soon as we got there this market fell over falling back down to where right back down to our second prediction area which was around 1.1886 in this zone is where we predicted a long trading opportunity where we predicted that we could see this market push up from in last week's video and we had every intention of getting involved if we got an entry reason at this zone which we did and we actually had a pretty nice trade from this zone that managed to bank in over a hundred pips on target number two's in the EAP. I'm going to go ahead and share that email analysis with you guys that was sent out to all members of the EAP. Here's that email and as you can see we had a euro dollar four hour long on September the 14th that was last week. The market pushed down to our potential long trading opportunity zone and we went ahead and bought those up when we saw some buying pressure based on an entry reason we used at the EAP. As you can see traders in the EAP program got a detailed description of why I was placing this trade along with entry stop and target number one areas. Now if we head back over to the chart you can see that that trade managed to play out pushing down at first and getting about 10 pips away from hitting our stop loss never did hit our stop loss and instead pushed back up hitting that target number one and on Friday we decided to go ahead and take off targets at this previous level of structure because we had the CPI coming out for the euro early on Monday and I didn't want to get called in some kind of gapping situation. So we went ahead and took off profits here at this previous level of structure for around a hundred pips on this trade. So as you can see guys this trade based mostly on structure based analysis which we talk about a lot here on these YouTube videos along with some specific entry reasons that we use in the EAP. So as you can see guys the technical aspect of trading is quite simple you know finding a few different conditions matching them with entry reasons in order to figure out when and how to enter the market. That's a pretty simple process that can normally be tall but you can normally learn rather quickly. The problem most traders run into is not necessarily the technical aspect of trading it comes with the psychology aspect. The problem most traders run into is the ability to stay disciplined to a specific trading plan. I see many traders that end up bouncing back and forth between strategy and strategy just after losing a couple of trades and thinking that one specific strategy doesn't work. So guys if you are having trouble with either of those aspects of your trading or if you just like to learn a little more about how I read the markets and the strategies that I use through a process like email analysis like what you just saw then what you can do is just click the link in the description labeled EAP training program to learn more about that program. Now as for our euro dollar predictions from last week let's go ahead and take a look at a short flip that was pointing out these levels then we'll come back and talk a little more about these two trading opportunities and after that we'll take a look at the other key levels of structure that we'll be paying attention to for trading opportunities here on the euro dollar for the rest of this. So I'm going to play you guys that short clip and I'll be right back. Now let's zoom back out to the daily chart and check out what we can expect next from the euro dollar. When we are hovering around that same 1.2049 level that level is a major resistance level here on the daily chart so we can be looking for shorting opportunities from here where we are. Bring opportunities as for support we'll go ahead and change the color of this line to blue because now the market is pushed above this level. This is going to be a level of support at 1.186 and that's all to where we'll be looking for more long trading opportunities in order to get involved. All right guys welcome back to the euro dollar and here we are on that daily chart and as you saw in last week's clip this was our area that we were looking for for shorting opportunities as you can see the market pushed down quite nicely from that area right into that area of support we talked about in the video clip in the last 4x market predictions video we released here at the trading channel and as you can see once we got down here we've had a decent push up now of a little over 100 pips which we took advantage of down on a lower time frame. So we got involved based on some buying pressure and entries and we used the EAP right around in this level and managed to bank in about 100 pips on that trade. So now let's go ahead and delete all this and we'll put the chart back out on a daily chart to discuss the next levels of structure that we'll be paying attention to for trading opportunities throughout the rest of the week on the euro dollar. All right guys so here on the euro dollar we have support which we've just bounced off of at 1.186 and that zone is our support level that we just bounced off of and we're now pushing up towards this resistance level once more around 1.20577. Now if the market breaks above 1.20577 possibly based on the interest rate decision we have for the United States this week then we could see this market push all the way up to our next resistance level at 1.2295. In that zone we may find some resistance for the market here on the euro dollar and we may get a possible counter-trained opportunity to the downside from this level. Now another scenario we must think of is what if this market breaks below our next support level at 1.186. So that is our first level of support but if the market breaks through that level what we're going to be looking at is a pullback into that zone and another push lower. Now the next level that could stop this market after that push lower is looking like 1.1645 based on some levels of structure we have looking left here on the daily chart. Now below that once more we have 1.1453 which is the next level we'll be paying attention to for targets if we're in a short trade and also for long counter-trained opportunities if this market starts a new downtrend from either of these levels. So that's what we're paying attention to this week and only the next week here on the euro dollar and on Monday we'll be doing all this again so make sure you're subscribed here to be alerted when that video comes out though you can keep up to date on these key levels of structure. For now let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. The next pair we're going to take a look at today and our last pair is going to be the Aussie dollar and on this chart last week we actually pointed out the 0.81 0.05 zone as a possible level to get short at and we did point out the 0.80 2 zone as well as a possible level to get short at we ended up being stopped out of a trade we took here so we had one loser on the Aussie dollar and then the market reacted to that level at 0.8105 pretty nicely pushing down from there so we'll take a look at last week's video first talking you guys through these levels then we'll come back talk to these trades and take a look at the levels of structure that we're paying attention to going into the rest of this week for the Aussie dollar so let's take a look at that clip and then i'll be right back zoom back out to the daily chart and discuss the key levels of structure we'll be paying attention to for trading opportunities now today we are hovering around this potential structure reversal zone in this zone we can be looking for reasons to go short on the Aussie dollar as a counter trend opportunity and if this market does break and close above the zone and continue higher our next level of resistance will be the 0.81 0.05 zone this is where we'll be looking for our next counter trend possibilities and for our second level all right traders so here we are back on that Aussie dollar daily chart as you can see our first red box here indicates that first level of resistance where we were floating around last week we ended up breaking above that level coming into our next level at 0.8105 the level we discussed in last week's video and pushing down directly from that level so let's zoom down to a four-hour chart and see what things look like down here on our trading time frame so we had some good selling pressure coming out of this area that we discussed in last week's video and last week we actually had a losing trade on this pair coming in around this next level here so once the market had broken above this level in red we changed that line of blue it was about right in here and we were waiting on a pullback into this zone for a long opportunity on this pair we pulled back into that zone and we saw some buying pressure from this area that gave us a reason to enter in a long trade and we ended up being stopped out on that specific trade but as you can see we had a pretty good move down from our level of resistance up here now let's go ahead and zoom back out to a daily chart after deleting these zones and take a look at what we can expect out of the Aussie dollar going forward so this market's currently pushing down making this blue line here our new level of resistance and pushing down towards our support levels that start around the 0.7886 zone in that area is the first place we'll be looking for long opportunities off this pair and if we continue lower then we may look towards the 0.7807 zone for our next long counter trend opportunities other than that if the market decides to push up our first level of resistance we'll be around 0.8020 zone and above that if we do break above that area we'll be 0.8105 yet again just as last week's video explained and we'll be looking at those levels for shorting opportunities here on the Aussie dollar all right guys so that's going to do it for the first part of this week's 4x market predictions video tomorrow we will be producing a video talking through the key levels of structure on the pound dollar the dollar swiss and the dollar yin so make sure you subscribe so you're notified when that video comes out if you want to be among the first to be notified when that video comes out then go over to the trading channel.net go ahead and sign up for our email list and doing so we'll ensure that you also receive the other valuable content that we do not release here on youtube if you enjoyed today's video guys go ahead and leave me a comment in the comments section below and let me know these videos do take me a fair amount of time to produce and edit and i want to make sure that you guys are actually receiving value from them so if you found this to be valuable then make sure to click that like button for me and make sure to leave me a comment below if you're struggling and you want a little extra help with your trading and i've left a special link for the eap training program in the description below this video click that to learn more about that program otherwise i hope you all have a great rest of your week op trade green throughout this week stay disciplined and i'll talk to you guys in the next video
