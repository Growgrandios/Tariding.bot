What's up, Steven here, and today I'm going to be answering a question that I imagine has crossed your mind at least a few times over the past couple of weeks. And that question is, should you be trading, should you be investing during this coronavirus scare? This panic, this panic that's causing volatility everywhere across the board and the forex market, and the question again becomes, is this a time to trade or not? Well, that's the question I'm about to answer for you, but before we do, there's a couple of things we have to discuss. Before we dive into that though, please let's subscribe button if you're interested in learning more about the forex market in general and how to trade it. Go ahead and click that like button for me while we begin the video. So should you be trading right now or not? Well, there's no solid answer to that question, but there is an answer that in my opinion is going to be of great benefit to you. And that is, if trading is new to you, if you're a brand new trading or if you haven't found a way to be profitable yet, then this panic, this huge amounts of volatility in the market, if you decide to jump all in, during it will more than likely hurt you more than it will help you. And the reason is because panic or not trading is always based on having an edge over the market. If you decide that you're going to go all in during a moment like this, when the market has high amounts of volatility, you can lose just as much as you have the potential to make right now. If someone's going all in right now, then you have a larger chance of losing money right now than you did before this type of panic was happening. You see the market's moving in these huge spurts, hundreds of pips in just hours. And because of that, you have the opportunity to lose a lot of your hard earned money. So because of that, if you're new to the markets or you've never traded before or you just weren't profitable before coronavirus panic, then you're not going to be more profitable just because this panic hit. And if you decide to jump in to dive all in and try to trade during moments like this, then I think in my personal opinion, at least that that is a terrible idea. I don't think now is the time to be diving headfirst into something new or something you didn't understand before. I think so, more often than not leads to someone losing some or all of whatever they decided to invest. Now on the flip side of that, yes, it's easy to lose a lot of money during times like this. But times like this also make it easier to make a lot of money as well if you know what you're doing. So if you were already a profitable trader, of course, yes, continue to trade. I didn't stop trading completely just because of this. And I don't think that if you're on your path to profitable trading and you're practicing things in a very small account, you understand risk management, it's not time to quit just because there's a panic like this, in my opinion. Now another thing and something, let me take this to a different level. If you're deciding, yes, I want to trade in these markets and there's nothing anyone can say or do to stop me. Remember this is not financial advice, more so for educational purposes and entertainment. But if you're deciding no one can stop me, I'm going to trade during volatile markets and try my hand at this lottery ticket. I'm going to buy the lottery ticket and hope I win big. If that's you, then there are things I need you to understand if you're watching this video before doing that because I do not want this to be one of those detrimental moments in your life that you never forget or one of those detrimental moments that keep you from ever wanting to trade again. That to me is a terrible, terrible thing because I know that trading can provide a great lifestyle, a secondary source of income or maybe even a primary source of income can give you the freedom of time, the list goes on and on. So if you've decided I'm going to trade during this time, get to a point in your trading that you at least understand risk management. So during times like this, it's easy to say, all right, hey, Steven, I've got $500 that I want to throw into the forex market and it's all I have. It's my life savings right now and I'm going to put it in there and I'm going to just go short on a per to ask me what pair should I go short on? What pair should I go long on by $500 to invest? I have no idea what's going to happen. No clue. During times like this, no one can predict what the next news release will be. No one can predict what's going to happen based on that news release in the markets. No one can. You need to have a prepared strategy that you were already using and then continue to use it during this, but let me jump back into the subject to hand. I need you to understand risk management. Understand risk management and risk capital. Right now it's super easy for you to lose money. So if you jump into the markets during a panic situation, during a ton of volatility, at least understand that put an amount of money, this is called risk capital, put an amount of money in that account that's not going to affect you dramatically financially. If you have your life savings, for instance, or retirement money, you don't want to be throwing that into the market during a time of great amounts of volatility. Use risk capital, amount of money, you could tolerate losing and if you do that, that doesn't mean we go all in on each trade. That's called risk capital. The next part of risk you need to fully understand, if you've decided I'm trading during the coronavirus outbreak, I'm trading during all this volatility in the market, the second thing you need to understand about risk management is called risk per position. So let's start over with a new example. Let's say you have $1,000 or let's say Jimmy has $1,000 to keep it from sounding like I'm actually giving you advice. Jimmy has $1,000 and Jimmy decides I'm definitely trading during this because I think I'm going to make a lot of money. That $1,000, let's say Jimmy's following the roles, he actually has $40,000 or he has $20,000 or $10,000 or whatever. Let's say $10. Jimmy has $10,000 and he decides I'm okay if I lose every bit of this $1,000. That $1,000 is called risk capital. It's an amount of money he's okay losing. So he's going to take that $1,000 and invest it into, let's say, a wand up and some kind of forex brokerage. And then this is where risk per trade is going to come in. At this point, Jimmy has his $1,000. That doesn't mean he's to take that $1,000 and buy as much euro dollar as he possibly can or sell whatever direction he plans to trade based on whatever he saw on YouTube videos or heard from other people or list goes on and on. This decides to do whatever he decides to do. He doesn't need to risk $1,000 on that bet because he gets one trade and then if that trade loses, he loses his entire account, that's insanity, right? So risk per trade is going to be out of that $1,000, Jimmy may only want to risk $10 on a specific trade. That would be 1%, or $20 that would be 2% on that specific trade. But in this case, because of this high amount of volatility, it gives you an opportunity to have a better risk reward than normal for everyone involved in the markets. So if Jimmy is risking $20 now instead of, let's say, his normal risk reward is $2 to 1, now instead of making $40, he might be able to make a 10 to 1 with all the volatility going on so that $20 he risks makes him $200. So therefore, he has enough, and if he loses, let's go back to this before I get into what he's made, if he loses $20 out of his $1,000 account, he still has tons of trades he can do. So if you can make that risk per trade, whatever agrees with your risk tolerance, maybe if you have a $1,000 account, you want at least 10 chances to be right and hit a home run, so you would risk $100 per trade. That $100 may double your account, may make you $1,000 if you hit a nice 10 to 1 trade, and it also isn't going to completely diminish your account if you lose two or three trades in a row. So from a straight as basic as possible standpoint, if you decide that no one can tell you in any differently and you're brand new to trading or haven't been profitable yet, and coronavirus is your ticket, and that's what you believe, and that's what you're going to do, please at least dive into some education about risk management or use the things that I just said at your discretion if you decide to, not financial advice at all, I'm not telling you what to do with your money, it's better if you don't trade it all during times like this, and if you don't know how to trade, please don't trade. But if you're going to, at least follow some basic risk management rules. Doing that won't keep you from losing all your money, but at least it'll keep you safer during times like this if you don't know what you're doing. On the flip side of that, again, if you know exactly what you're doing, keep doing it. There would be no reason to stop, right? So that's what I wanted to talk about towards the beginning of this video is understanding risk management in times like this, and the should you or should you not trade during times of panic is determined by whether or not you were pro, is it something you know? Were you profitably trading before? If so, then nothing should change. And if you were not able to make profit before a pandemic isn't going to help, more market volatility isn't going to help. Now, again, if you've decided to trade during high amounts of volatility, I'm going to show you what I think are some of the best strategies to trade during those high amounts of volatility. So let's dive into that right now. Talk to you in a second. Just kidding. I did not realize this video was already over nine minutes long. So because of that, I'm going to do the full strategy video, which is also going to take a while and I'll put the link in the top right hand corner of the screen and the description so I can separate these two videos because I don't want this to run into a 30 minute video or so. So if you want to see that video, it'll be linked in the description and in the top right hand corner of the screen as soon as I get it finished and edited. Now here, what I do want to do though, is show you a practical application of risk management. So now we've talked about important risk management is, but you may be in a position where you don't really understand how to use it. And what we're going to do is use Jimmy as an example. So let's say right now, Jimmy has $1,000. Jimmy has 1,000 buckaroos and he decides this is enough. He wants to put this in his trading account. His risk tolerance allows for this to be risk capital. And if he loses $1,000, it's totally fine. Now risk per position, what we just talked about in risk per position scenarios is how much of this account does he want to risk for every trading places. Personally, I have a risk management role that says I don't risk more than 2% on any particular trade. In this case, that would be $20. But you may be coming in to the markets during this virus or this virus may have occurred and all this panic and volatility coming to the market. You may be like, okay, look, I just want 10 or so chances to hit a really, really big trade that can help me almost double my account. Well, if that's the case, you may, if Jimmy was thinking that, Jimmy may say, okay, I'm just going to risk $100 and I know that I have 10 chances now to make a big trade because 10 times our $100 risk is going to be $1,000. So this is highly dependent on your risk tolerance and what you're in the markets for at this time. But the way to figure this out, that's what I want to teach you again, that practical application is every time we place a trade, we need a place we're going to air the market and at least for my personal trading, it's mandatory for me to have a set in stone stop loss. This is where I know I'm wrong and I'm getting out of the market and I want an area that I'm interested for targets. So in that case, let's say here on the pound dollar, we have a trade set up that looks exactly like it looks right now on the screen, right? Let's say I had an entry right there and I knew my stop loss was right here. This is an area of support I'm paying attention to. I want my stop loss below that area of support and below our previous swing low and I have some target ideas for back here. If that's the case, I already know my entry and my stop loss in order to calculate how much risk you have on each trade you place, you will need an entry and a stop loss at least the target. Again, you want to have an area where you're interested in taking targets. You never want to just let a trade run forever because what if it turns around and ends up stopping you out? So an area for targets, an entry and a stop is necessary now that we have those three things because we know our stop loss is going to be a certain amount of pips. In this case, 130 something pips, then we can calculate how many units we need to buy of this currency pair in order to have a 2% risk like this $20 would be 2% or this 10% risk based on our account value. If our account value is $1,000 and we want to risk 2%, we can now calculate that based on our stop loss. So let's talk about how to do that. You can either do some semi easy but also takes way too fucking long math or you can come over to trade and view where I'm at right now. You can look at this at a 132 pips stop loss from where the market is right now. You can right click, go to trade and create a new order. You can put a market order in to buy the pound dollar which is what we wanted to do. You can put your stop loss price because your entry is already recorded. Stop loss, you can either put in price or pips. I'm going to do pips which was 132. So with the 132 pips stop loss, I can now come right here on the trading view platform and see percent risk. Whatever your account is, you can see your percent risk right there on the right. So if you have a thousand dollar account, then whatever that thousand or whatever percentage you want to risk is what you would type in right here. So if I wanted to risk, let's say 2% as I normally do in my own personal trading, I would come here and click two. Once I click two, it tells me what my 2% risk is in dollars and it tells me how many units to purchase of this currency in order for the stop loss amount to equal that 2% risk. So this is the practical application of risk management. Now that you know kind of along the lines of what risk management is, this is how you actually apply that to your trading is by setting a stop loss that you know, okay, if the market gets to this level, I'm wrong. And then basing your risk amount, the amount of units you purchase on a certain percent of your account that you're willing to lose per trade, which is risk per trade. So if your risk per trade, 2%, then 2% of your chart lookout value for Jimmy's example, thousand bucks, 2% of that would be 20 bucks. So if we want to risk 20 bucks, then we can see the amount of units we need to purchase in order to risk that $20. And I can do this right here as well. If you just want to risk $20 every trade or $10 every trade or $100 every trade, you can come right here at USD risk, click $10 or let's say 20 on Jimmy's behalf. So $20 is going to be 1,515 units of pound dollar. Done. That's all I needed to know. A hundred dollars, if you're in for the 10 chances to hit the lottery type trades, then a hundred dollars would mean you need to buy or purchase 7,575 units of the pound dollar. With the spread, those are a lot more complicated than I'm going to get into in this video. But essentially, this is how you apply that risk management plan into your real trading. So I hope this has been helpful, especially in terms of risk management and how to apply it to trading. But even more importantly, in terms of whether or not you should be trading, and again, guys, please do not jump into this if you're new or a struggling trader and expect coronavirus to make you rich. There's a lot of opportunity, but just as much opportunity to make money, there is opportunity also there to lose money.
