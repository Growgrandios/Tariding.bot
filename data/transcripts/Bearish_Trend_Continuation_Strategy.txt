So in the bearish direction, we would be looking for quite the opposite. We're looking for price to push lower, create a low, a lower high, and then a lower low. At the moment we create that lower low, I'm going to be marking off my previous level of support that price broke in this downtrend. Once I have that marked off, I'm going to be looking left to see if this is, in fact, a level that has been tested more than once. So at least twice. We have once, we have twice. If this is a level that price just broke in my downtrend and a level that's been tested multiple times, then I know I'm looking at that level as what I consider an OTZ, which stands for optimal trading zone, which means I'm going to be looking in that area for possible trades for trend continuation. Since we're in a downtrend here, that means possible trades to the downside or possible short trades.
