What's up traders, welcome to the trading channel. And welcome to this week's video, my potential trade setups episode two. This is your first time viewing one of the videos we have here at the trading channel, then I'd like to say thank you for checking us out. Go ahead and hit that subscribe button if you enjoy free educational content about Forex trading. Here at the trading channel, we strive to help new and struggling traders understand the reality of Forex trading, which is that Forex trading is not something you're gonna learn in a month and be extremely profitable and successful. Forex trading is not easy and it's definitely not a get rich quick scheme. In order to master the skills that are necessary for you to be successful at trading, it's going to take a lot of time, energy, and effort on your part. And here at the trading channel, we offer tons of free educational content here on YouTube. In order to help traders not only understand that aspect of trading, but we also offer tutorials on how to read structure strategies and how to handle your psychology and discipline while in the markets. If you'd like to check out some of those videos, then you can find those by typing in the trading channel in your YouTube search bar. We also offer a subscription based trading program and I'll leave a link in the description below the video and in the top right hand corner of your screen for anyone interested in learning more about that. With that said, I'm gonna go ahead and let the intro and disclaimer roll. Make sure you click that subscribe button if you're new to be alerted when I come out with new potential trades set up videos and I'll see you guys on the other side of the intro. Yeah. Welcome back traders. So the first thing we're going to do is take a look at our previous potential trade setup from last week's video. This setup was only $0 and let's talk through a little bit of the analysis that went into this trade. So last week we were taking a look at a higher time frame level of structure and if I zoom out to the daily chart and place a horizontal line here and we'll change the color of this line to red. As you can see, this is a level of structure. The market had tested multiple times and reacted from. So because of this, I was interested in a shorting opportunity from this level down on a lower time frame. And last week we discussed that opportunity being an advanced pattern. And guys, if you'd like to see last week's full potential trades setup video, I'll put a link in the description and I'll also put a little card in the top right hand corner of your screen for that. But last week we did discuss that we would be waiting on an advanced bat pattern at this level. And if you didn't see last week's video, see if you can spot that advanced bat pattern. We were looking at this as the impulsive move down. This as our retracement up and I'll bring on a Fibonacci tool. To show you guys that retracement, which was a 50% retracement, meeting the first rules for our bat pattern. After that, we needed at least a 382 retracement from A to B. And we got that. And after that, all we were looking for is the 886 retracement for the D point or entry point of that pattern. As you can see, that point was hit. We ended up being able to take out a position right there. Getting involved there with stop loss above X and our initial target at a 382 retracement. And currently still up on the second part of our position at around a four to one risk reward on that second part of the position. So a really nice trade based on the potential trade setup video from last week. And I'm actually gonna play you guys a small clip from that video pointing out this potential trade. So let's check that out now. And if this trade does get stopped out on the second part of that position for break, even I'll still be looking for a short trade here on the four hour or hourly timeframe. Because based on my high timeframe analysis, this market could go much lower than it is now. So what might we be looking for out here on the four hour chart? We could see this turn into a advanced pattern entry. Looks like we're gonna get a bat pattern out here on this timeframe. And what I'm gonna do is actually go ahead and delete everything off the chart to make that easier to see. So out on the four hour chart, some potential setups that we're looking at, as I said, would be this bat pattern. Now go ahead and draw this in for you guys. X down to A, A to B, B to C, CD completion at the 886. We also have this level. All right guys, welcome back. So this week's potential trade setup is going to be on the New Zealand yen. But before we get into that, if you would like to be alerted about these potential trade setups before I release the videos on YouTube and get first access to these potential trade setups, then head over to the trading channel.net. There'll be a link in the description below. And I'll also put a link in the top right hand corner of your screen and go ahead and sign up for our email list. If you do this, you'll receive my potential trade setup emails before I release the videos here on YouTube each week. So let's start to discuss the potential trade setup for this week on the New Zealand yen. Go ahead and delete everything off the chart and we'll start out here on the daily chart. And the question I always ask it first is why? Why would I like to be involved in the market at the level it's at right now? Why is this a potential trade setup? And the reason why normally comes down to higher timeframe levels of structure that have been tested multiple times. As you can see pointed out by my red line is a level of previous support here on the New Zealand yen that's been tested multiple times and that the market has reacted from multiple times. Now, since the market is back up to this level, we know that previous support can sometimes become resistance and the markets already put in some long weeks to the top side. If I zoom in over here, you can see that a little better and also started to push down today from this area. Now seeing that, I will go ahead and go down to a smaller timeframe, a trading timeframe like the four hour chart and we'll start looking for opportunities. Now for this specific trade, since we have broken below this level of support, pulled back into our daily support level, a potential trade setup is to aggressively enter this market if this candle that's currently open, that's currently moving, closes below the low of this previous candle. So that would be a very aggressive potential trade setup using that higher timeframe structure. Now for more conservative entries, we can look down on a lower timeframe like the one hour chart. And here since we've already got our move down, I'll be looking for a few different things. It's gonna be a very similar setup to last week's potential trade. If we pull down here, you can see we get more than a 382 retracement there from X down to A. We're gonna be pointing out an advanced cipher pattern here. If I bring all my extension tool from X to A and back up, you can see that we get that 127 extension without closing below 1.14, which gives us our second rule for the advanced cipher pattern. And now all we need is the market to push up to our 786 retracement to complete this pattern. So similar to the Euro dollar trade from last week, for this potential trade setup, we'll be waiting on either that four hour candle, lower, lower, lower, close, or this market to push back up into an entry on this advanced pattern. Now similar to last week's potential trade setup announced it's only Euro dollar. Here at the trading channel, we're also gonna consider a potential trade if this market creates some type of simple pattern. So we have a push down that has broken below our previous level of structure. And now if this market will continue to consolidate, pushing down and up, down and up, down and up, and then break out of any type of simple pattern, then that will be our next potential trade setup here on the New Zealand yen. So there's a few different potential trade setups here on the New Zealand yen, and we'll briefly go back over them from start to finish guys. And this is going to be a great example of how you can start doing some analysis on these four X pairs is by taking a look at your higher timeframe, in our case, it was the daily chart, finding levels of structure that have been tested multiple times, such as this previous support level, highlighted by my red line, then we drop down to the four hour chart to see that we have a possible lower, lower, lower, close candle that we can use to enter this market in a very aggressive way, or for more conservative traders, looking down at a lower timeframe, we have a few different potential entries looking at this being a possible simple pattern, breakout trade. Or even a possible advanced cipher pattern. All right traders, so that's going to do it for today's my potential trade setup video. I hope you enjoyed the content.
