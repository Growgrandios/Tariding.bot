Over 80 pips in less than 24 hours on one trade. Welcome to another educational and hopefully valuable video guys. Today we're going to be talking about the Euro Dollar. This is a pair that we had predictions for in this week's weekly market predictions. And we talked about a couple of possible trades in that weekly market predictions video. And one of those trading ideas is the one you see on your screen now. So that analysis ended up playing out quite nicely. And today I'm going to take you guys through the Euro Dollar and show you the exact analysis, the exact setup and how we took advantage of this move and ended up banking in over 80 pips in less than 24 hours.

Just like the one yesterday where we pointed out this trade you see on your screen. While you do that, I'm going to go ahead and let the intro and disclaimer roll. And I'll see you guys on the other side. Welcome back guys. The first thing we're going to do is actually take a look at a clip from that weekly predictions video that we had yesterday. Pointing out the trade that you see on your screen. This way you guys can see how the analysis we do in those weekly prediction videos can really create some good trading opportunity. So let's take a look at that clip now and then we'll come right back to the charts and discuss the actual trade that we placed here on the euro dollar. And my two support levels for the euro dollar. Now let's take a look at what our initial bias is on this pair. What are we looking for out of this market currently throughout this week in particular. And if this close happens to be below this previous support level, then my initial bias and my bias for this week only euro dollar will be bearish. I'll be looking for short trades down into the 1.1664 level. So how can we get involved knowing that short bias that we have? Well, we can look for a few different things out of this market including some kind of retracement to get involved going short. And there is a situation where we don't get a retracement at all and this market continues lower. In that case we may look on some lower time frames for a way to get involved in the bearish direction here only euro dollar. So that's what we're paying attention to here only euro dollar. Alright guys, so here we are back down on that 4 hour chart on the euro dollar. And as you can see, if I go ahead and draw that horizontal line there, we did get a nice close below that support level on this time frame. And that's exactly what I was looking for before trading one of two options. The first option was a deep retracement that we could place a trade from. Second option was some kind of simple pattern heading in the bearish direction here on the euro dollar. That second option is exactly what we got. So I'll take you guys down to an even smaller time frame, the one hour chart where we actually placed this trade. And as you can see here, not only did we get a nice consolidation pattern looking a lot like a flag pattern coming in like this, but also we ended up getting a pullback right into this previous level of structure. So once we got that pullback into that level of structure and we broke below our flag pattern, just as we discussed in the weekly prediction video, we went ahead and placed a trade based on that information, based on that analysis. We had a complete trading plan, a complete idea, based on our trading plan. The only other step was to go ahead and execute that trading plan, go ahead and execute that idea. Such as exactly what we did, we managed to bank in around 80 pips on the first part of that position, on the first position of that trade. Currently our stop loss is right at break even, and we're hoping to see this market continue to fall, at least down to the 1.1664 zone. This is where we'll be taking off the second part of that position. And if we get down there, this will be a very nice looking trade, hitting around a 5 to 1 risk reward on that second part of the position and over 180 pips. But currently our stop loss is set at break even if this market stops us out, we have managed to bank in a nice amount of profits on this trade. And just to rewind a little bit, we can also head out to a daily chart, and I'll show you guys another reason we're really interested in this trading opportunity. It's because on this daily chart, only $0 pair, we just pushed down from a very important level of structure. That level of structure pushing down also gave us a bearish bias on this market, at least on the lower timeframes. I know it doesn't look like a bearish bias if we zoom the chart out, right? This is definitely an overall uptrend, but the $0 has not broken below the support levels the whole way up, right? We have these support levels that the market has held, not even a test, not even a pullback to test that support level, not even a pullback to test this support level. And then now we come back it down and not only test that support level, but as you can see if I zoom the chart in, we're starting to break below it. So we're starting to see some possible bearish moving on the daily chart, and that does not mean that I'm going to be looking for short trades on the daily chart, but that does give me inclination to look for short trades on smaller timeframes. And I know for some of you who are newer to trading or for those of you who have traded for a while now without using structure, this kind of analysis probably sounds really complicated. And that's one of the main reasons that I do these weekly prediction videos is to make sure that you are consistently seeing the same type of analysis so that it helps you learn exactly how to incorporate these major levels of structure and exactly how to incorporate structure into a trading plan and a trading strategy. So that's what I'm hoping to achieve with all of these videos guys. And if you want to learn even more about trading this way and even more about structure, then there's a couple of different options we have for you, and you're more than welcome to do both. You can sign up for our email list. There's a link in the description for that. And after doing so, we do send you free content that we don't produce here on YouTube such as trainings that deal with structure and advanced patterns and other free valuable content for you being a part of the trading channel community. And we want to a little more organized and step by step process to incorporating this kind of trading into your trading plan and a step by step process has already taken many traders from consistently losing money to being consistently profitable. Then we also offer a training program called the EAP in that program. You'll learn more about how to trade using structure levels and some of the strategies that I use them all in personal trading along with email analysis of trades that I plan to take and much more, but I'm not going to fill this video with all of that. If you want to learn more about that program, there is a link in the description below with a special discount and that link is labeled EAP training program. And if you don't want to get involved in either of those, then that's okay too. Just make sure to keep an out for the other educational content we produce here on YouTube.
