What if we see price doing something like this? We see a pullback. We see this candlestick pattern happen after the pullback. This candlestick pattern could be an indication that the pullback is over and we're gonna see trend continuation out of whatever market we're looking at at this time. The pattern itself, I think golfing plus one, is just an engulfing candle followed by a green candle. If we're looking for botrytes, we're looking for cell trades, it's gonna be exactly the opposite. We're gonna be looking for a downtrend. We're gonna be looking for a pullback. We're then gonna wanna see a bearish and golfing candle, which means we have a green candle. We then have a close of the bearish candle body below the open of the green candle. To put more simply, we want the red candle body to be larger than the green candle body. At that point, we wanna wait for one more thing for that confirmation that this pullback is over and it's just a red candle after our engulfing candle to show that sellers are really taking control. Here at the end of a pullback, while we're in a downtrend in this specific case. Okay.
