Over the past three weeks I've been sending out a report to a very exclusive group of traders. This report is called the Pro-Trader Report and in it. I've been pointing out my top three to five zones that I plan to take trades in throughout that particular week. On the screen in front of you you can see examples of some of those zones, examples of some of those reports and how they've worked out. As you can see from those examples, this creates some really accurate trading opportunities and what I'm going to do today is actually show you exactly how I point out zones like this in order to trade around. And not only that, I'm also going to teach you how to create a trading plan, a full strategy around these zones and around this type of trading. So if that sounds interesting to you, then I can't wait to get started directly after the intro to disclaimer. Make sure you're subscribed here. Click the button below the video to the right hand side and the notification bell because we come out with valuable content like this each and every week. Make sure to click that like button while the intro and disclaimer roll. I'll see you directly after. All right, traders. So as promised, we're jumping right into today's content with how to identify extremely accurate levels of structure just as we do in the pro trader report each and every week. And there is no better way for me to give you an example of that other than showing you exactly what happened last week from one of our OTC or optimal trading zones that we use exactly what I'm going to teach you in this video in order to point out. Let me show you the actual pro trader report first. Here is this report and it is on the Aussie dollar. As you see on the Aussie dollar, I will actually leave a screenshot of this up in just a second, but this is an example of the actual pro trader report. Right here we have a support zone. This zone is between 0.7028 0.7073. We go back over to the Aussie dollar itself and I'll put a screenshot to the left hand side over here. I left you right probably, but right there at 0.7073 in that area right in the zone we pointed out is where the market came down into and then shot up by over 120 pips from. This is exactly what happened based on the pro trader report from last week. So how did we point out this level? That's exactly what I'm going to be teaching you and even more importantly than that throughout this video, I'm going to show you how to actually build a strategy, build a trading plan around this information. So let's zoom out one of the biggest things I'll say about this specific way of pointing out optimal levels of structure is that it's most effective on higher time frames. So you're going to be wanting to look for these rules on high time frames such as above the four hour chart. I wouldn't go any lower than that. And personally, I do this on a daily chart personally. So on the daily chart, what I look for to point out these zones that move the market around these zones that end up making for optimal trading zones is levels of structure that have been tested multiple times. When I say multiple, I mean more than two or three times. So in this specific case here on the Aussie dollar, we had a level of structure that have been tested once, twice, three times as support. And as the market was pushing above this and coming back into that level, I assumed that this zone of structure that had been tested and reacted from, right? The market was reacting from this level multiple times here and here. As the markets tested and reacted from it multiple times in the past, I assumed that it would happen again. I assumed we would see this market do the same exact thing. This is a super simple process of pointing out levels of structure of the market that can be used as optimal trading zones. And whenever I say that, all I mean is that these levels can be used as a condition for a trading strategy because this is what normally happens. And we're going to go into more detail and a little bit more depth on this in just a second. But let me explain this first. This is what normally happens. A trader comes to a video like this. They see this. They go out in the markets. They point out levels of structure that have been tested two to three times, right? But they have no plan around those levels. They have no strategy. They have no entry reason. They literally email or message me here on comment here on YouTube asking me, Stephen, how do I enter in the trade? Or, Stephen, what do I just buy at the top of the zone? Do I just buy in the zone, sell in the zone? And then what should I use for stops and targets? These types of questions have to be answered in your trading plan. I'm going to teach you how to answer those questions momentarily throughout this video. So what you need to understand is that these zones are not the be all of the forex market. These aren't going to be zones where every time the market gets into them, you can just place a trade randomly and you'll make money. You will lose your account if you do that. And that's why this video is going to be based around teaching you how to create your own strategy and your own trading plan based on this information. So now we have a condition. Our condition is that the market, let's say, must be at a level of structure that's been tested more than three times or at least three times. Now that we have that condition in place, the process of building a trading plan consists of only a few things. Every professional technical trader that you know uses five different things to build any technical trading plan. Those five things are they use structure or they use trend. They use indicators, candlestick patterns or price action patterns. Those five things, an accumulation of those five things creates every technical trading strategy there is in the entire world. That's just facts. So if that's the five, I guess you could say tools we have in order to create a trading plan in order to create a strategy, then those are the only five things we can use. So for instance, if you're sitting here looking at this and we have a level of structure, let's say this been tested three times at least, the market comes into that level. What you need to do is create rules, right? You need rules for these levels of structure. The rules can be tested three times after rule of three X tested. What you need is entry rules, entry rules. What does that mean? That means maybe your only condition is that the market has to be at this level of structure. At that point, you need an entry rule. Every entry, rule, every entry reason of any technical trader, any technical trading strategy that you've ever seen heard of or any technical trader that you know is based around three separate things. It's either based around a candlestick pattern, a price action pattern or an indicator. Those are the ways we enter the market. It's not enough just to be at a zone. It's not enough just to be in trend. We have to have entry reasons as well and you can combine trend and structure and indicators and all these other things as conditions and then use an entry reason, but we won't dive that deep into that right now. What we're going to talk about is how to actually make money based on these levels of structure, optimal trading zones like this. The way we do is by creating the strategy, right? We have rules for our three X tested level of structure, let's say. We have entry rules. Those, the only reason you need entry rules and let's say just be very, very simple at this point and say your entry rules are hammer and I spelled that wrong. Deal with it. Sorry guys. Hammer and shooting star candles. This is how you enter the market. After that, you need to stop and target rules based around whatever you want to base it around. Let's say you have a 10-pip stop just to be super simple and a 20-pip target every time you place a trade in this way. Right now, what have we done? Because this is where a lot of traders stop. A lot of traders do this and then they're done. They're like, okay, I created my strategy. I'm going to go trade this forever and make millions of dollars, get my Lamborghini, quit my day job and be super successful. That's what they think and that may be the path you're on currently and that's what we're trying to completely get you away from. Trying to fix for you is the fact that this process right here, creating what we call a rules based trading strategy and trading plan, the only purpose of that is so we have testable rules that we can back test in historical data because we don't know that every time we're at a three-ex tested level of structure and we get a hammer or a shooting star candle and we use a 10-pip stop loss and a 20-pip target that we're going to be correct. We don't know what the percentages are and in trading the only thing we're trading based around percentages and probabilities. So what we need to know is how often are we going to be correct using this specific strategy or any rules that you create. I hope it's starting to settle in now. Your creation of a rules based strategy is there so you can take those rules, test them through historical data, come up with your probabilities, your percentage chance to win, your average risk reward, your drawdown, come up with all your probabilities, optimize and then create a trading strategy and a trading plan around that. That's the whole purpose of creating rules. And again, what I see most often is traders create the plan but then don't want to do the work of back testing the plan and figuring out its limitations such as drawdown, figuring out its ROI and the percentage chance of win ratio and figuring out the risk reward ratio that's an average for that specific strategy. All that has to be done through historical data testing. That's the only measuring stick we have. So that's what you must do first. That's what you must do in any type of trading strategy, any type of trading plan. This is not excluded. It's not that this is a great way to find really good trading opportunities. But having a great way to find really good trading opportunities will not make you a profitable trader or a professional trader. This is what will creating a rules based strategy based around that information, testing it, optimizing it, then implementing it in a demo account. And then when you're ready implementing it into a actual trading account, another thing I see a lot is in demo traders just go trade random shit in demo accounts. Like what was the purpose of that? That makes no sense. If you're going to trade in a demo account, it needs to be trades based on a rules based strategy and a trading plan that you've already created. So keep that in mind as well. We'll continue now with this video and we're going to use this example from here on out. Let's use the example of waiting for a 3x tested level of structure to be our optimal trading zone, then waiting for the entry reason of a hammer candle or a shooting star and using a 10 pips stop loss of the 20 pips target. We're going to do this on an hourly timeframe. And that's what that's what we're going to do. We're going to go ahead and go through markets and take a look at this right now. In this specific scenario, we just took a look at the pro trader report where we pointed out the zone. This zone was pointed out because of the one, two, three right here, x tested level of structure that we have. We go down to an hourly chart in our zone. Let's see if we have a hammer candlestick in the zone. And if we look, it turns out that we do not, we have other candlestick formations though, such as a double bottom right here, right? We have this little bitty double bottom that could have been used as entry. That's what I mean when I say price action patterns, right? We have different price action or different candlestick patterns that can be used as an entry reason. Now, the point is not let's go trade every double bottom in the scenarios. It's to have those rules in place. You can test them historical data, optimize them and then create a trading strategy based around them. Let's jump down to another pro trader report we had. Now, I actually bring that back over one more time for you guys because it was a dollar. Nope, that was wrong. Hold on. It was the, here we go. Okay, found it. It was the Canada Swiss OTZ. In this case, we had a support zone on the Canada Swiss. We were looking at a 0.7496 to 0.7521. Let's jump over to the Canada Swiss and we'll see if we have one of those shooting star or hammer candlestick formations. In this case, let's zoom out to the daily. Let's check out why we were looking at this as a trading opportunity. In this zone, we plot a horizontal line right here. You can see that we have a level in the market that have been tested multiple times as support right in this area. And as resistance, we have one, two, three, four and that four tested level of structure gives me a reason to believe this level could act as resistance or support again, depending on where the market is. In this specific case, the market was pushing down to that level. It was also a previous level of structure, resistance that had just been broken. Because of that, when the market got down to that level, I knew I wanted to look for a trading opportunity in this zone. This was the optimal trading zone we pointed out. As you can see on the screenshot that I have posted on the screen somewhere. But that being the case, we wanted to drop down to smaller timeframes and looking for opportunities there that we have tested through historical data, the strategies that we've tested and use, the exact process of building a trading plan, it's what I had to do to become a professional trainer. If I wouldn't have done that, I would still be struggling too. And the way I did that was by exactly what I just explained to you, testing strategies that aligned with these rules along with entry reasons and other conditions. And then optimizing those strategies on the best pairs to trade them with, the best times to trade them and using the best entry reasons stops and targets, optimizing, and then demo trading and creating a trading plan and then going live. That's the process I took as well. If you want access to the actual rules that we use, the actual trading plan I have, I do provide that information to everyone involved in the EAP training program. The ProTrader Report will give you a lot more access to training like this. But in this specific case, there is a, well, there's, yeah, there is actually a hammer candlestick right here on the one hour chart. So the market comes down into the zone we're talking about. This is a situation where the trading plan we just created, the strategy we just created would have worked out really well. The market comes down into this zone and then right here, what is this red candle? This red candle indicates a hammer candle. We have a close of that candle and a high of that candle that is towards the high of this actual candle itself and a long week at the bottom side, depending on your rules for a hammer candle. According to mine, this would be a correct hammer candlestick. So what would happen here? Well, what would happen here is you would take a long position. If you were trading based on the plan we created just a few minutes ago, then you would take this situation, you would go, okay, I have a 10-pip stop right here. I have a 20-pip reward. Give me a two-to-one risk reward on this specific trade. And that's exactly what my trade would have looked like. At that point right there, if we zoom in, is where I would have known I was interested in this as a trading opportunity. Where in my zone, we get the hammer candle. Okay. So I'm going to do the trade because that's the only rules we created. Well then I go, okay, well, did it win? Yes, it did. And this would be the process of backtesting that specific strategy. Again, I don't know whether or not it works. I've never tested this strategy. I don't know if you trade this 100 times, if you're going to lose money or make money. That's for you to decide, for you to do the work and figure out through the backtesting process and no one can do that process for you. So in this specific case, you would have won that trade. Let's actually see if there's any opportunities setting up in real time. Let's check some charts now. I'll go through the top five major pairs just to test this out and see. Okay, so I found a situation here on the Canada Yen. If we go down to the, or out, excuse me, to the daily chart, you'll see that this area is an area that's been tested multiple times. It's one of our three X tested levels right here. That's pretty easy to see with the structure of support here, support here, support here, and support looking left even further back as well. And the market's already came into this area and pushed down, which is actually something that I normally try to avoid. If we've already had a pretty big move out of that area, I don't normally look for an opportunity again. But for the sake of this video, I want to show you guys exactly what we'll be looking for. If I've pointed out my zone, and I know I have a level of structure in the market that's been tested three or more times, then I can drop down to a smaller time frame and using the exact strategy we just kind of created earlier in the video, what I would be doing is just looking in this zone that we created on, let's say, the hourly chart, four hour chart, whatever time frame you want to go down to, what I would be looking for is this market to get into this zone and then put in a shooting star candle. When it did, I would have a 10-pip stop, a 20-pip target, and this is how I would trade that strategy if it's a strategy that provides an edge over the market. The only way to find out if it is a strategy that provides an edge over the market is through your backtesting process. So now, throughout this video, we've talked about one of the best ways to find an optimal trading zone, a trading zone that can provide extremely accurate opportunities when combined with the correct entry, reason, and other conditions. I've also talked a lot about how to actually create a trading plan and a full strategy around these levels of structure. The way you do that, just to recap quickly, is to test entries and test other conditions in these areas. For instance, if you combine all of the information we just talked about, maybe wait on the market to get to a three-exested level, and then you wait for instead of just an entry, and you add another condition. We want a three-ex tested level. We want RSI to be OS or OB. Then we look for the entry reason, which could be the hammer or shooting star candles, right, depending on the direction. If you combine other conditions, such as indicators, like the RSI being ever bought and ever sold, it can add to the accuracy of a strategy as well. So then what you would do is you would go through the market, let's say we still have the stop and target is 10 pips for the stop and 20 pips for the target. That again, optimize this. Don't just go out in the market and start trading this, please. You will more than likely lose money. You will have to go through the market, test this on specific currency pairs, and actually create a strategy and a trading plan around it. But using this specific scenario, the purpose of all of this information is that you have rules now. Now you can go through the market and actually test and see if something like this would be profitable. If something like this gives you an edge and you trust me, you don't want to trust anyone else whenever it comes to your hard earned money. So doing this, doing the testing yourself actually gives you a huge advantage because you're able to see the potential ROI of the strategy that you're using. You're also able to see the potential drawdown it has. You don't have to just take someone's word from it that creates YouTube videos or provides a course. Even in the EAP trading course, a huge part of that program is that I require every single trader that comes through the program to back test the strategies that I teach on their own. Yes, I know that the strategies I teach are profitable for me, but I want the traders themselves to go through the process as well because that's going to create confidence and discipline. And without the back testing process, they will never be able to overcome the hurdles of live trading. They'll never overcome the hurdles of discipline, the hurdles of risk management. They'll never be able to actually create a profitable trading career unless they go through the hard part, the back testing, everything else on their own. So I require this of every trader I work with and it should be no different for you. You should require yourself to know your strategy in and out, to know your trading plan in and out before you trust yourself trading your own hard earned money. So keep that in mind guys.
