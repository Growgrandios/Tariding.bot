Nearly every single one of us come into the Forex market from a place of scarcity. You didn't come into the Forex market thinking, oh cool, here's a new skill that I'm gonna be patient and take my time to learn and master and then eventually I'll risk my hard-earned money and try to grow it into more money through the process of investing in the currency market. That's not the way you were more than likely looking at it if you're anything like I was and like 90% of people that start trading are, then you were looking at it more like this. I need a way to pay my bills. I need some extra passive income. I need a way to fix the car that took a shit on me last week. I need a way out of a job that I absolutely hate. That means that you were coming into the currency market from a place of scarcity. There's nothing wrong with that in a sense and in itself that's totally fine. That's how we all start. But what this causes is the real issue. Coming into trading from a place of scarcity means that you likely are coming to your computer each day. You're opening up your laptop, you're walking over to your home office, whatever it may be. You're looking at charts, you're dropping down to a five to a 15-minute time frame. You're making an excuse to go long without doing any real legitimate analysis and you're hoping that the market goes up just because you bought it and you need extra money and that's not the way the market works. Unfortunately, that is a path that way too many traders take until they blow their entire accounts. So what I want to do in this video, share with you a three-step system that I've used since I became a profitable trader in order to stay ahead of the markets all the time. This way, I'm not coming into the markets and just guessing. No, I'm coming in the markets with a plan detailed and rules-based that I know provides me with an edge, that I know can equal more money in my account at the end of a month, more often than less money in my account at the end of the month. So if that sounds interesting to you, make sure you go ahead and click that subscribe button and like button for me. They're both down below the video. I'm going to let the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll see you on the other side. Let's get started with the three-step system that in my opinion, every trader should start their trading day with. This is the analysis that I do every morning before I actually place a trade. It all starts with number one, which is what trend is this market in. So if I'm looking at the euro dollar as we are now, the first thing I would ask myself is what trend is the euro dollar in, depending on your time frame. We'll go over those in just a second. Next, I'm going to ask myself what are the areas of value for this market, the current market you're looking at, whether that be the euro dollar, the euro Canada, the New Zealand dollar, whatever it may be, you need to find your areas of value. And three is what is the likely scenario based on those two factors. So I asked myself these three questions and what we're going to do is break down the top five major pairs by asking ourselves this three-step system. First, let's look at the euro dollar. What trend is this market in? When looking for trend, this gives me an idea into the likely scenario of that market either heading higher or lower. We've all heard it before a market that's in trend is likely to stay in that trend until something happens. So when determining trend, if you're a complete beginner, then I would just suggest plotting a 50 period exponential moving average on the chart and saying the market is in an uptrend. If the bodies of candles are all above my 50 period moving average, we're in a downtrend if they're below and if bodies of candles are touching the 50 moving average, that is consolidation. Now, if you want to tackle the beast that is trend in financial markets, then this is how we read it. We go from a starting point here to a high to a lower excuse me, higher low to a higher high to a higher low to a higher high to a higher low to a higher high in the moment that our most recent higher low is broken is when we expect there to be a possible trend change. So at this point, we're not in an uptrend. We're not in a downtrend on the euro dollar. We're in what's likely to become consolidation. So after I have that decided and by the way, this is something you need to be very comfortable with. I see so many traders that are like, no, Stephen, I have to figure out what trend we're in. And I look at a chart and go do lady, we're not in a trend, whatever it may be, whether it's a guy or girl, we're not in a trend. We are in consolidation. That's something you need to be okay with is understanding that the market's not always going to be in a trend one direction or the other. In a situation like this, the euro dollar right now for me and the way I do my analysis is not in a trend. So I don't have that as a bias. Okay, I can move on my next step after figuring out that there's no trend, but instead we're in consolidation. What's the next thing I need to be doing? I need to be looking for areas of value. And let me show you exactly how I do that. All I mean by areas of value is what are the areas they're likely to move this market. We're on a daily chart right now. As I said, we'll discuss time frames in a second, but just looking here at the chart, most recently, we have an area of support and resistance that is recently being used by this market. Okay, resistance there, support there. We just broke into new lows based on our previous lows. So I have a very slight bearish bias, a very slight bias to the downside on this bear. So if we get a pullback into my area of value, this is the part about being prepared, if we get a pullback into this area right here that is in red, that will be an area I'd look for possible short trades reason being because trend wise, we're in consolidation slash a slight bias to the downside, considering we just broke a previous higher low and closed below it with this candle. We now have an area of value. The market's used multiple times as support and resistance. By the way, my definition for an area of value is an area in the market that has been used at least twice by the market as support or as resistance. Once I have those two factors met, I'm asking myself the third question. What is my third question? What is the likely scenario based on those two factors? Based on those two factors, I can confidently say that if the euro dollar preparing, yet again, not jumping on the screen and going to the five minute chart and hoping and praying that my trade works out preparing by saying if the euro dollar gets into the area between 1.2183 and 1.2140, that is an area I want to look for short trades based on the bias I have based on those other two factors. This is how you prepare. This is how you actually perform legitimate technical analysis to prepare for what the market's likely to do in the future. So with that being the case, you can see that that is my three-step system here on the euro dollar, but I'm not done yet. I don't only want to prepare for what I'm going to do if this market had tire because if that's the case, then this is the area I'm looking for short trades. But what if we had lower? What if this market takes a tumble, a dive? Well, if we do, do you see what I would consider an area of value based on the roles I just shared with you? An area that's been touched multiple times by support or resistance. If I point that out for you, this is what it would look like. We have an area right here that the euro dollar is used as resistance multiple times looking left and that is definitely an area of value for me. I'm going to color this one green to show you that it is support and not resistance and what's going to happen here at this point is that if, again, this is the third step, right? That was the second step. We found our area value. What is the likely scenario based on those two factors? Based on these two factors, the market just now breaking below this low, we have a likely scenario that this market pulls back, hits my level of resistance, pulls down, hits this level of support and finds support from this area. So what am I planning to do based on that? Well, even if we don't get this pullback up, if this market pushes down to the area between 1.1958 and 1.1880, that's an area I'll look for a possible long trade, possible buys because I know that it's a very likely scenario that we get a bounce out of that level. Whether that bounce pushes up into new eyes or is just a bounce before a continuation of trend, it's very likely that this green zone provides support for this market based on the other factors that I've looked at being trend in areas of value. So let's go ahead and move on to the pound dollar and do the same exact thing on the pound dollar. Let's discuss this quickly. What trend are we in right now? If you're doing it the complicated way, which works better than a moving average, but is a lot more difficult to master than you know that we are currently sitting in an uptrend reason being we have a low to high, high or low, high, high, low, high, high, high, high, low, a higher high, we've now made what? We've now made this equal high, but have we broken below our previous higher low, which is here? No, we have not. And that is the air. That's what we need to look at. We need to be looking right here and saying asking ourselves, have we broke below that if we have not, we're still considered to be an uptrend until that happens. So considering we're in an uptrend, I have a slight bias to the upside. What's my next step? After that upside bias after determining the trend of this market, my next step is determine an area of value. So I have trend. What's the area of value? What about right here? Are you guys seeing this? Right here, we have an area that's been tested multiple times as resistance. You could even claim that it had been tested here as support as well. So with that being the case, I have trend bias to the upside. I have an area of value. I'll paint green for you. And so what's next? What's the likely scenario best based on these factors? If the market continues pushing down and gets into my area of value between 1.3477 1.3378 between those two numbers, the likely scenarios that we get a bounce to the upside. So what am I planning on doing? If that happens, I'm planning on taking bot trades based on entry reasons on lower time frames in these areas. So that's exactly what I'm planning to do on the pound dollar if this scenario takes place. Now, exactly like we did on the euro dollar, what if this market just had tire and doesn't get down here to my area of value? Well, I want to make sure that I'm prepared for that situation as well. The way I'm going to do that is look for my next counter trend area of value. So I'm going to put a horizontal line on the latest high that the market made most recently. I'm then going to scroll the chart back until I find an area of value. How do we define an area of value? By an area the market is used multiple times as support or resistance here. Support support area value. Cool deal. Now I just need to go back over and paint this area red so that I know it is an area of resistance. And then we'll talk about the third step, which is what is the likely scenario and what am I going to do about this analysis? Well, for trend, I know we're up where to the upside, but an area of value, this strong can be a nice counter trend area to look for short trades even though we're in an uptrend because the likely scenario is that we hit this area and we have at least a pullback, possibly a reversal completely. So with that being the case, what am I going to do about that analysis? That means that between the area of 1.3835 and 1.3755, that's an area I'm going to be looking for possible short counter trend trades out of the pound dollar. Hopefully now you're starting to see why it's so important to prepare for situations in the financial markets, in the forex market, in the currency market, like we are in right now. You want to be preparing for these situations. You don't want to just jump on charts, go to a five-minute time frame and pray that your trade wins. This is how you actually perform legitimate technical analysis that can give you an edge and turn into a system that makes you money over time. That's my pound dollar analysis using that three-step system. Let's go USD yen. Only USD yen. Tell me what kind of trend we're in now. Let's go ahead and mark it up just a little bit here. We have a high to a low and actually this would be our previous swing low. So the real way this would go is a high to our next lower low to our next lower high, which is right here to our next lower low. And what has just happened on this market? This market has just broken above its previous lower high. With that being the case, what does it mean? It means we're not in trend anymore, just like with the euro dollar, but in the opposite direction. Now we can see that for this market, we're in consolidation. What it's telling you essentially, while the market's making these lower lows and they're easy to see, it's making these lower highs and it's easy to see, lower lows, easy to see. And then we get a breakup that pushes above our previous lower high. The market's not sure anymore. We don't know, the market doesn't know that it wants to continue this downtrend. If it did, what would it have done? Would it have made a new lower high and then continue down? So if the market's unsure, then we can expect some type of consolidation before it gains that assurance once more. And that's why once we have that break of the previous lower high, we consider that consolidation until the market proves to us that anything wants to go higher by breaking this resistance or continue lower by breaking into new lows. So that's our analysis here on the trend of the dollar year. And what's next? Next, we want to see about the areas of value on this specific currency pair. What are those areas of value? Well, what do we look at? We look at areas that have been tested multiple times as resistance and support. This is an area we actually pointed out last week on the pro trader report and in the best setups of the week video I do each and every week for members. Actually, let me play a clip from that really quickly so you can see that I pointed this out already. And then we'll dive back over here to the dollar in talking about what I'm expecting next out of this pair move on. Now we have a dollar in area of interest as well. I know this is extremely hard to see. And I'm sorry about that. But this is just some testing that I still have to get done with. So I'm going to leave that on the chart for now. But if you look really closely, you can see an area of support right here. You can see an area of support right here. And we have resistance right here as well. So what this is and what we call this is an optimal trading zone or in short an OTZ. And OTZ is just defined as a level in the market that's been tested multiple times recently. So this area between 104.64 and about 104.6 even is that area that's been tested multiple times recently. With that being the case and with us having an OTZ year, what do you think I'm going to be looking for? So as you can see from that clip, we had this 105 even 104.5 even handle number around this area pointed out as an area we'd look for possible short trades out of the dollar yen since then we've had a pretty nice move to the downside since I pointed that out last week of about a hundred bibs. So now that this markets in this area, you might be thinking Stephen, are we looking for trades out of this area to the short side again? No, it's already made the move I expected. I expected a push down from this area. I got a push down from that area. So next up I would be looking above the highest high of price, which is my blue line right here. This is the highest high price made right. I'd be looking above that to my next area of value. And the next area of value I have is right in this area. Reason being we have a level of resistance that was also support support support looking left when I find areas in the market that have been support and resistance multiple times in the past. They are areas that I consider areas of value. So with that being the case, that means that this area between 105.59 and 105.1 is going to be an area I look for possible short trades on lower time frames if the market makes it to this region. Now again, just like with every other pair we've looked at, I don't want to be prepared for every situation. So how do I prepare if the market goes lower? Well at the moment, if this market heads lower from here, I'm not going to be looking right here for support. The reason is that this is still the latest swing low and if this market decides to come out of consolidation and push lower, then this is going to be a bad area for me to try to buy the dollar end. So what I have to do is, let me delete these real quickly, go with a horizontal line here at the low of price, the previous low, the most recent swing low we've made, which is right here. Now that I have that, I can find my counter trend level of support, which wouldn't you not know it is right in this area. So we are flirting or we'll be flirting with this area if the market pushes down into new lows. We'll be looking between 102.46 and 101.9.4 for possible long trades out of the dollar. Yeah, and we're pretty far away from either of these two scenarios. So this is not going to be a pair that I'm paying attention to for this exact system throughout the rest of this week or probably for the next, yeah, probably for about the next week or so with where the market is now. Next up, we're gonna take a look at the Aussie dollar. This trend should be extremely easy to identify. Let's mark it up for a second. First question of this three-step system is what trend are we in? We have a low to a higher high to a higher low to a higher high to a higher low to a higher high. Right now, what trend are we in on the Aussie dollar? We're in an uptrend. So now that we have that bias, what are we going to be looking for? Our areas of value. What are our areas of value? Well, we're going to place a horizontal line at the most recent level of resistance that was broken. We're going to scroll back just a bit to see if we have that as an area that's been tested multiple times. My goodness, look at that it has. So if my most recent level of resistance that was broken in this uptrend was tested multiple times, what does that mean? That means that this is in fact an area of value. So with that being the case, what I do is plot my lines on the chart as so and I'll be waiting on this market to get down to my area of value that I'll color green in order to look for what? Well, if it's an area of value and we're in an uptrend, then I have my bias. I have an area of support while the market's in a definite uptrend. This is definitely going to be an area that I look for possible long trades out of the Aussie dollar. So if we get to the level between 0.76, 4, 2, and 0.7591, it will be an area I look for possible long trades on lower time frames to continue this daily uptrend on those lower time frames and make it possible to get some really nice risk to reward, reward to risk ratio trades. So that's why I'm looking at only Aussie dollar and again, I hope now you can start to understand the type of analysis you need to be doing. And since we were talking about the five minute chart before what I would do if I was trading five minute charts or 15 minute charts is I would get the hourly time frame here. I wouldn't pay attention to the daily if you're trading on the 15 and the five minute chart, the daily's not really gonna matter all that much in terms of what you're doing. So I would drop down to about the one hour chart. The same analysis applies. Let's do it right here on the Aussie dollar. Only Aussie dollar. What trend are we in? Let's draw it up. We have a high pushing down to a low lower high, a lower low right here. And then what are we waiting on right now? What are we in? If this is the case because this candle, let me explain a little bit about this. If this candle would have broken and closed below the previous low, that would have been our new lower low. But because it did not, then we had to go all the way to this next lower low. Now that that's the case. What does that mean for us here? Own the Aussie dollar on the five minute chart. I mean, excuse me, on the one hour chart. What are we looking for after we find our trend? We're looking for areas of value. What is the area of value you can see on the chart right now that stands out like a sore thumb? It would be where? Right here, right? The market's heading up to it now and it's definitely an area that is acted as major support and resistance in the past. So if the market's coming into this area now, then this area between 0.7731 and 0.7720 is definitely a place I want to look for possible short trades to one, be in trend continuation and two, because we're in an area of value. So I'd want to go down to lower time frames and look for possible short opportunities to get on board with this downtrend while I'm in an area of value that I know gives me a very likely scenario of winning that trade. So if it was our three step process, here we go trend downtrend area value right here between 0.7731 and 0.7720. And what's the likely scenario? The likely scenario if we hit this area is that it pushes the market down. That's what I want to be trading based on. So here on the Aussie dollar, that would be the five minute analysis that we would do. Let's jump back out. We only have like one other pair to go. So don't get too impatient. Now jump out and say, what if this market pushes up instead of down, breaks into new highs? Oh man, that means we missed out on a trade. Well, we want to be prepared for that so we can get into a counter-trained opportunity if the opportunity does present itself. So how we do that, we would place a horizontal line at the latest swing high. Do you see how systematic this is before we keep going, how organized it is, how consistent this analysis is in order to be a consistently profitable trader who knew consistent, which is in the words consistently profitable trader is one of the main keys to doing so. So finding a way to have absolutely consistent analysis down to every minute detail that you possibly can is one of the easiest ways to stay consistent. So as you've heard me say multiple times throughout this video, how do I find my counter trend level of resistance? If this market entire, I want to see a counter trend level that's likely to provide a push down. How am I finding that? Every single time I'm placing a horizontal line on the previous swing low or swing high, the most previous one that occurred. In this case, it's right here on the Aussie dollar. After I have that, I just take, scroll my chart back and find the next level of resistance that is above it, which is where it's right here. Oh, that's definitely not it, right? It's right here. I'll get it eventually guys. It is right here. Let me change that to pink to make it easier to see. It is right here. I think I've already said that like six times, you get the point. Here we are. This is the next level of resistance I have. The next question I ask myself is, has this area been tested multiple times as support and resistance? The answer I get is absolutely it has because it was tested here as resistance here as resistance here as resistance here as support and the market, the price react price reacted to the market at these areas every single time. So with that being the case, what does that mean? That means that this area in pink is where I'll be looking for possible counter trend trades if we head higher. So if this market had higher, I have a trading opportunity that I'm prepared for. If this market had to lower, I have a trading opportunity that I am prepared for keyword being prepared, not jumping again, not jumping on the chart, placing a trade because I need money and just hoping the chart goes in the direction I wanted to dollar Swiss will be the last pair we take a look at. Here we are on the daily chart. Let's do this analysis. What trend are we in right now? Draw it up just a little bit here. We have a high to a low, lower, high, lower, low. We're pushing up to that previous high right now, at least as it stands, we are in a downtrend still on this market. We're to downtrend until what happens until one of these candles closes above our previous level of resistance or our latest, lower, high. At that point, we'll be in a possible reversal, not necessarily in an uptrend, but no longer in a downtrend either. But right now, as it stands, we are in a downtrend. What am I going to do? Since we are in a downtrend, what is step two in the system? I'm going to find my areas of value on this chart. The first thing I want to do is look at exactly where we're at because of the fact that we are at the previous level of resistance. With that being the case, I want to see if this level of resistance has been tested multiple times. If so, I want to start looking for possible trades right now on this market. Scroll the chart back as far as you need to see if this level has been tested multiple times. The answer in this case is yes, but here's the thing. I don't like the fact that we had to go through this in order to get to it. I want to see it being tested multiple times, especially for counter trend levels as the most recent, like I would need this to be the support level right here, not for it to be passed where price is broken through it and went back above it already. I don't want to see that. So with this being the case, this would not be a level I want to pay attention to for short trades at the moment. So with that being said, what is the place I want to pay attention to for short trades? Hopefully it's pretty easy to see. I'll change this back to blue. Our area of value is right here. Why? Because this is the area most recent to price that has been tested multiple times and reacted to Bob price. So if this market had higher, the area between 0.9034 and 0.8993 is where I'll look for possible short trades in trend continuation. And at this point, it won't be trend continuation, but depending on what the market does, it might not be counter trend either. We might just start seeing consolidation. But I'm prepared for it. If the market goes higher, no matter what trend we may be in, I know this area of value is strong enough to cause a probable push down. More than likely we'll see a push down out of this area here on the dollar Swiss. So with that being the case, I do have my level of resistance pointed out. If this market heads lower, what's the next thing I want to do? Well, I don't want to look at this as a level to buy unless we do get a close above this level and go into an uptrend. Then I would consider this a nice counter trend level. But at the moment, this level is just the previous swing low. This could very well be an equal high before we get trend continuation out of the dollar Swiss. So I don't want to be trying to buy when the market could easily go into trend continuation. For that reason, I'm going to place my horizontal line on the most recent swing low. Here we go again. Same process. This most recent swing low, scroll my chart back and find my next area of value for the dollar Swiss. It's kind of funky because the area values way down here. But with that being the case, that's what I'm drawing in. This area right here is the most recent level of support the market used to push it higher. So that will be an area I look at for possible support on the dollar Swiss chart. Geez, I had to scroll a long, long way. So that's the analysis on the top five major pairs. That is also the three step system I use each and every time I look at markets in order to give me accurate trading opportunities.
