And I'm going to let the intro and disclaimer roll and be right back to share with you guys the step-by-step process that took me from a brand new trader to becoming profitable. I'll see you guys on the other side. Welcome back traders. So the trade you see on your screen is a trade we discussed in Monday's weekly market predictions. We talked about this dollar in pair and we did some detailed analysis on this pair in that video. And we consistently have winning trades like this making well over 150 pips of profit each and every week. Now we don't only win trades we only win around 57% of the time. And knowing that is what allows us to stay consistent to our plan is what allows us to stay consistent and consistently make trades like this week in and week out. So I just want to use this trade as inspiration to show you that what I'm about to discuss with you is extremely powerful and I contribute most of my success to the process I'm about to share with you guys. So let's head up to a white screen and talk about the step-by-step process of becoming profitable. Now this normally starts out or always starts out as you being new someone that knows very little to absolutely nothing about the forex market. Now at this point you're just curious you probably saw it add or saw a YouTube video that talked about how you could make tons of money trading in forex. Now unfortunately we have to nip that in a bud as soon as possible. Going from a thousand dollar account to a million dollar account in a year two years three years is not a logical way to look at forex trading. So let's go ahead and go through the process and then we'll talk a little more about the logical way you need to look at your trading. From a beginner you go from this to learning about how the market moves maybe learning some basic charting techniques such as learning about candlesticks and maybe a little bit about structure and in order to do this I personally and I feel like most new traders do this through watching YouTube videos and through Google maybe invest OPDF for some of the information. So this brings you from brand new to being novice. Now you understand that the market moves and pips for the forex market you understand what resistance and support are you understand what the anatomy of a candlestick is. You've now went from a point of being brand new to watching a few YouTube videos for free typing some things into Google and figuring some of those things out and this is the process I went through as well and after that you realized there is a way to make money doing this that things can be predictive. So now that you have this information the next step that I personally took and I contribute a lot of my success to this next step because most people go from this point to trying to trade. Instead I learned about risk management next. Next I learned that the market wasn't going to give me a million dollars from a thousand dollar account in a year and that it was very easy to go from my thousand dollar account straight to zero if I did not have the correct risk management in place. So learning about risk management early really saved me on some time and on blowing accounts which I see is extremely beneficial so in my opinion going from new to watching some videos and understanding some of the basic aspects of forex trading and then learning about risk management is going to be your best bet. Most people go from this to our next step which is going to be learning strategies. So most people skip over this part and go straight from their YouTube videos their free Google searches to learning about strategies and that unfortunately can get traders into a lot of trouble. They'll see videos of people promising that a strategy makes a hundred percent a month or you know a hundred percent a week and they'll start trading that strategy with very poor risk management and without ever back testing that strategy and actually figuring out the drawdown that it comes with or frankly figuring out anything about the strategy and that leads to blowing an account that's why 90 percent of traders blow their accounts is because they completely skip over the risk management portion of this step-by-step process to becoming profitable. So after learning about risk management we just talked about it then you can move on to learning strategies simple strategies and honestly guys I use simple strategies to this day that I learned in this process. The strategy you use does not have to be the most complicated strategy you can find. More complicated does not equal more profit 90 percent of the time when we're talking about trading strategies. So once you have these things once you've learned about the basics, why the market moves, understanding candlesticks, you've learned about risk management, you understand that you don't need to be risking 10 percent of your account per trade, things like that. Then you move on to learning strategies and guys you're really close at this point to understanding how to be a profitable trader. Once you learn strategies then you can apply the risk management techniques that you learned to the strategies you learned. Now this process can't happen until you've back tested your strategy and you understand the drawdown it comes with things like that but before we get into that let's go ahead and go on to our next step. After learning strategies our next step is going to be back testing that strategy. We do this so that we can understand the type of risk management plan we need to use with this strategy according to the drawdown it comes with throughout historical data. Now I've got to draw this out but this is going to be our profitable trader all the way up here. So now that we have our back testing done let's say we have our correct risk management plan now comes the most difficult part. A lot of traders stop here and they try to skip straight up to profitable trading from back testing. Can it happen very rarely? This happens. Next you need to start with either a demo account or a very very small account in order to work on trading psychology and discipline. These two things are going to be the most complicated and the most difficult things that you have to master to become a profitable trader. The trading psychology the discipline portion of trading is by far the most difficult to learn and the most difficult to implement into your strategy. So for me the process I went through was new trader, YouTube the basics, learn about risk management, learn some strategies, back tests for literally a year or more and thousands and thousands of trades and then after this step I could not do anymore on my own. I still was not disciplined even after back testing. I actually had to involve myself in a program and watch a professional trader go through drawdowns and actually come out on top in order to get my discipline in trading psychology in order. So even after all of these I was not able to be a profitable trader and this was a lot of work and I feel like there's probably a lot of you watching now that have already done all of this and this is the one that you're missing is right here our trading psychology and discipline and that's exactly where I was at. Learning these takes a little bit of time but they are relatively simple concepts to understand and relatively simple things to achieve. This one over here that we've pointed out already our trading psychology and our discipline this one is very complicated to implement because it's emotional. Our brains tell us losing money is a bad thing no matter if it's just a small portion of the time you've traded the strategy that you lose money no matter if it's just a small drawdown a few percent of your account loss our brains tell us that's a bad thing that we need to do something different. So this is the point where most people switch strategies or just quit all together. They'll start trading a strategy without having the proper discipline in trading psychology and after a few days a week two weeks of drawdown they'll switch the strategy. Now let me show you something that will help to put all of this into perspective. If we head over to the EAP spreadsheet this is the spreadsheet from the email analysis program and this is how we keep up with each of the email analysis trades that we send out week in and week out. We do about three to five of these per week that we send out to clients and on average our drawdowns last between one and two months. So what does that mean? Let's take a look right here as you can see we had on trade 88 right here we have the New Zealand dollar and we have an account balance or let's call it a percentage gain of 64 percent. Now when's the next time we get back to 64 percent or above? If we scroll down here we're not there we're not there we're back up to 64 percent but we're not at our previous equity high which was 64.22 percent that's when we get above it right down here at trade number 110. So from 88 to trade 110 was a drawdown how much time was that? That was from 621 to 810 that's over a month and a half around 45 days of drawdown. So let me go back over to the chart and ask you guys how many of you could start an account 1k let's say you start a thousand dollar account on day one and then let's fast forward time it's now day 44 not day 45 let's say you're a day before getting out of your drawdown on day 44 the account you started with 1000 dollars has 990 dollars in it. Be honest with yourselves how many of you would continue to trade that strategy. Hopefully this is a wake-up call hopefully this is an aha moment for some of you because this is exactly what's happened to us profitable traders this is what's happened to us trading during a year that we've produced over 126 percent return. So let's head back over to the spreadsheet and I'll show you guys that. This year in the EAP even with that drawdown and we have an average drawdown of around a month and a half and we've had three or four of those this year so with that being the case we still have a total percentage gain of 126 percent. So that goes to show you that even with a drawdown lasting a month or a month and a half or longer you can still have a fantastic percentage gain over the course of a year and that's why discipline and trading psychology are going to be the most important parts to your trading they will be the most important aspect that leads you to a profitable trading career because without them a return like this would be completely impossible even for us profitable traders. If I had not stick to the trading plan through that 44 day drawdown if we head down to the spreadsheet we'll make this easier to explain so if I would not have stuck through the 44 trade drawdown we had right here this was our 44 trade drawdown on our equity curve then I would have missed out completely on the rest of the gains for this year if I would have quit the strategy right here if I would have changed strategy switch strategies right there then I would have completely missed the rest of this game throughout the rest of 2017 this is why discipline and trading psychology are so important and I really just wanted to hammer that home in today's video I hope it was helpful oh now you understand the step-by-step process to go from being a new trader to actually becoming profitable of course if you need help with that process then check out the rest of our YouTube videos we have plenty of educational content here at the trading channel and of course we also have a paid program called the EAP trading program which has helped many traders go from brand new to becoming profitable and also to go from struggling in their trading people that have traded for a couple of years without becoming profitable have now after taking our program managed to create trading success and I'll post a few other comments on the screen now so in order to help with discipline and psychology the two aspects that I think are the most important to your trading in this program we actually send out email analysis which are trades we plan to take three to five times a week and we have a review video at the end of each week explaining our drawdowns we're going through explaining how we're going to come out of it and explaining how we're staying disciplined to the trading plan in hand there's also a complete training course teaching the strategies that we use in order to profit from the market each week and much more if you get involved in that program so if you'd like to learn a little more about that then there'll be a link in the description below if not that's okay too just make sure you're subscribed here to be alert when we come out with more free educational content here on YouTube make sure to head over to the trading channel.net and sign up for our email list or click the link in the description below to get your hands on a free structure training series also free butterfly pattern tutorial for those of you interested in advanced patterns and to make sure that you are alerted first when we come out with our weekly market prediction videos each Monday.
