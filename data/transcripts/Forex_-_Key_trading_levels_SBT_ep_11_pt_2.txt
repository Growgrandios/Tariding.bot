We've actually pushed up quite nicely from this level now as I said before the intro We actually had a loss on the pound dollar and I'll share that with you guys now We had this market pulling down in this major structure level and after we had the nice push up and the gap We kind of expected this thing to gap and run we expected something like a Push up a little pullback of retracement and then another push into the 1.303 zone that we pointed out last week So because of that we went down to a smaller timeframe and we ended up getting long on this pair after about a retracement from the swing low up to the swing high that broke above our 4-hour level of resistance that's something else where we're looking for is the market to bounce off that daily level of structure and then break a Smaller timeframe level of resistance like the 4-hour or 1-hour chart So after we got that then we were expecting a little pullback into the 382 We ended up getting an entry reason around here and unfortunately we got stopped out just by a couple of pips Not too long ago. So that's a loss we had on the pound dollar so far this week But let's go ahead and talk about what could be coming up next for the pound dollar I still had the expectation that we make it up to Our 1.303 zone before we pull back and break even lower now Nonform payroll for the US does come out tomorrow's so that may have an influence on what this pair does but right now we're looking at this as a Push up breaking above that structure level and a creation of this 4-hour flag pattern We're trying to see what's gonna happen from this market now that we've pulled back You know we have been stopped out of this previous trade, but my bias is still the same I'm still looking for a long position because of this heavy push off of our daily Support level that did end up breaking our 4-hour resistance So with that being the case we'll be considering an entry if we can get a breakout of this flag pattern on the 4-hour chart So let's zoom back out for the daily chart and take a look at the other key levels that we'll be paying attention to for the pound dollar All right So if this market does pull back, we may be looking for support or for buying opportunities around the 1.28 1.4 level That's where we're looking for our next buying opportunities and if the market breaks through that area then the next zone for buying Opportunities down at this previous daily support level around 1.265 now if the market pushes up Do we may see this market fine resistance around the 1.303 zone for a nice shorting opportunity? And if we break above that level then the next level will be looking at 4 resistance our major level of resistance up here at 1.3227 so that's it for the pound dollar I'm gonna go ahead and move on to the dollar yen and here on the dollar yen As you can see we had a nice bounce off the support level we were discussing last week in structure based trading episode 10 part 2 I'll link that in the top right in corner of your screen in case you want to watch that full video But here at the 108.73 zone is where we expected this market to find some support and possibly push up And we wanted to see this market push up to at least our 110.71 area And that's exactly what we got we got a nice push up to that level and currently this market right below that level of resistance So I dropped down to a smaller time frame and show you guys a little bit about what we're gonna try to get out of this market Tonight tomorrow and on into next week We're gonna be looking for this market to push up just a bit higher and actually touch our zone here and Then see if we can get a reason to short the market around 110.71 And if we don't get any kind of entry reason another thing to remember guys is we're not just trading at these levels based on the levels Themselves those are just conditions that we need met before we can look for our entry reasons So once the market hits these levels we wait for an entry reason and if we do not get an entry reason and we see this market Push above the 110.71 area then we wait for the market to pull back to that area as support and then push higher So there's you some useful information about reading structure and what I'll do is go ahead and zoom out to the daily chart And we can take a look at the other major levels for the dollar we end so for major structural resistance We just took a look at the 110.71 area our first red line and the next level we'll be looking at resistance is 112.02 reason for that is because of the multiple tests we have out here on the daily chart You can see orders being accumulated here here here and here So there's a good chance that the market gets back up to that level There will be an accumulation of orders to push the market down now as for support We've already bounced off this support level But if we see the market come back down and break below the 108.73 area then we'll be looking for 106.79 for our next level of support and for our next buying opportunities That is caused by these two areas of accumulation here as support and here as resistance That's what we're looking for on the dollar again. Let's go ahead and move on to the dollar Swiss the last pair for this video All right, so here we are on the dollar Swiss and here we have a market that's in a period of consolidation If we zoom out the chart you can see our previous period of consolidation That was right in here and down here in the same area now We're seeing a similar form of consolidation So as you see this was a pretty large period of consolidation and if we just drag the box over here You can see that we have started a similar event We have a few different tests of resistance here at the top of the box and a couple of tests of support as well And with a market in consolidation like this I really don't like looking for trading opportunities But there's still a way to take advantage of these key levels of structure as you can see the market did push down recently and Then pulled back and what do we pull back into? Right into our previous area of support from this daily chart and now that we've pulled back into that area You can see the market starting to drop So respecting the key levels of structure still and as I said We're really not looking for much out of the dollar Swiss until we break out of this consolidation period We may see a buying opportunity right down in there where our blue line is and where you see that this market found some support Before but the problem is that that area that zone is gonna stretch from here all the way down to our lows So that's that's gonna be a pretty large zone where we can find a possible long entry So if that be in the case we're gonna be waiting for the market to test a little bit lower in this zone Before we go and try an actual long position But if the market does push even lower than that, let's consider the fact that we could push below That level in the next level of support that we'll look at is at 0.92 9.9 now for resistance We are currently floating around a resistance level at 0.9623 And if we push back above this level then we could look at our next level of resistance at the top of this consolidation period up here At 0.9763 in that zone So that's what we're gonna be looking at here on the dollar Swiss And that's the key levels of structure that we have on the pound dollar dollar yen and dollar Swiss I hope you found this video to be useful If you did then make sure you click that like button for me to support the channel If you have not already make sure to go ahead and subscribe here to the trading channel If you want more free educational content that we don't post here to YouTube Then make sure to head over to the website at the trading channel net and sign up for our email list If you do so then you'll receive other free material in your inbox such as tutorials and one of my own potential trade setups each week So if you're interested in that then there'll be a link in the description for the email list and guys If you'd like to avoid the painful process of creating your own trading strategies and trying to figure out how to become disciplined in the market Own your own and shorten your learning curve to becoming a professional and profitable trader Then I would suggest checking out our training program the EAP if you want to learn more about that program and how I can help Your trading then click the link in the description labeled EAP and I'll also put a link in the top right hand corner of your screen And with all that out of the way guys, I hope you have a great rest of your week and upcoming weekend I wish you all the best of luck on your future trades and I'll talk to you guys in the next video You
