Hey, traders, are you reading candlestick charts correctly? That's a question you have to ask yourself, and it could be directly contributing to your ability to profitably trade in any market. So in today's video, we're going to be talking about the anatomy of a candlestick, and later on in the video, we'll even be diving into how these candlestick charts can help us to determine and predict market direction.

All right, traders, so we're going to go ahead and quickly go over the anatomy of the candlestick, and then directly after that, we'll talk more about what it actually represents and how we can use these candlestick charts to determine market direction. So let's go ahead and talk about the candlestick that you see on your screen. Each candlestick is going to have four main points. Your main points are going to be the open of the candle, the close of the candle, the high of the candle, and the low of the candle. The opening close will be determined by the top and the bottom of the actual body of the candlestick. The body of the candlestick is this green area you see here, and green represents a bullish candle or a candle that closed above where it opened. So this candle had a starting point, and as soon as the hour, day, or weekly candlestick that you're looking at started, as soon as that candle starts, that is considered the open, and we'll talk more about time frames in just a second, but that's considered the open of the candle. Now, what happens after the open is shown by the shadows or the wicks, which are these black lines here, and by the close of the candle. The shadows in the wicks represent where price action went. So in this case, we would have had a candle that started here at the open, pushed down to the low, then back up, and then passed our close to the high of the candle, creating that wick, and then back down and closing at the end of whatever time frame you're looking at to create the close of the candlestick. So for this example, let's pretend that this is a daily chart. So the beginning of the day, this market would have opened here at the open, price action would have moved down to the low, up to the high, and then back down at the end of the day to close right here at our close. And this is an example of the anatomy of a bullish candlestick. Now we'll quickly go over a bearish candlestick as well. Now as you may have noticed, these two are very similar. The only difference in a red or bearish candlestick is the fact that the close was below the open. So here we have the open, and again, we'll use this as a daily candle, just for example purposes. So the beginning of the day, we have an open here and this candle would have opened there, pushed up to a high of the candlestick, pushed all the way down to the low, creating that bottom wick, and then closed at the end of the day, right at our close. And since we have a close that is below our open, then this candle represents a bearish day. So that time frame was a daily time frame. So that would represent a day where markets fell off, a day where markets closed below where they opened, and that would represent weakness in a market. So that was a quick run through of the anatomy of a candlestick. Again, the high represents the highest point price action got during this specific time frame. For this example, we were using a daily time frame. So this would be the highest point the market got to in that daily time period after the open, which was here. And this would be the lowest point price action got during that daily time period until it pushed back up and came here for the close for a bearish candle. The close will always be below the open or on the bottom of the body of the candle. And for a bullish candle, the close will always be on top of the body or above the open of the candle. All right. So now that we've quickly been over the anatomy of a candlestick, let's jump into what these candlesticks actually represent. And then later on, we'll discuss how we can use candlestick charts to predict market direction. All right, guys, so let's dive into what these candlesticks actually represent. Well, each one of these candlesticks represents a specific time period. If I click over here on time periods, you can see that we have time periods ranging from one minute all the way to one month. So with that being the case, if we were to click the one minute chart, then each candlestick would represent one minute or 60 seconds of price action. We would have the open of a candlestick every 60 seconds on that one minute candlestick chart. We would have price fluctuating within those 60 seconds down to the low, up to the high. And then we would also have a close of a candle every 60 seconds. So each one of these candlesticks would represent 60 seconds on a one minute chart. And if we were on a one month chart, if we go all the way to the other end of the spectrum, then the same rules apply. If we were only one month chart, if we were to click this one month chart here, then each candlestick on that chart would represent four weeks of price. Actually, we would have an open at the beginning of the four weeks. We would have price action in between the four weeks going to the low and the high of the week or the shadows of the candles. And that's what would represent where price action's been. And then we would have a close of the candle at the end of four weeks. All of this is represented by one candlestick depending on the timeframe you're on. So currently we're on a one week chart. That means that when we scroll down the chart here, each one of these candlesticks represent a full week of price action. With the green candlesticks, we have a full week of price action that started at the open or the bottom of the green candle. We have price action in between represented by these wicks coming down to the low and moving up to the high. And then at the end of the week, we have the close of the candle. So that represents a bullish week in price action for our current pair. Currently we are on the pound Aussie. So for this pair, during this full week of price action, we had a bullish week represented by this candle. Now the same thing applies for a bearish week and I'll go through that really quickly. So for this case, we have an open at the top of the body is where this market opened. We have where price has been represented by the wicks, the high and the low of the red candle and the close of the candle at the end of the week at the bottom of that body. So that would represent a bearish week of price action. And again, guys, these same rules apply no matter what time frame we're on. And this can go anywhere from a one minute chart all the way up to a one month chart. So each one of these candlesticks represents a certain period of time. And once we start putting these candlesticks together, it's when we can start determining market direction based on candlestick charts. So that's what we're going to dive into now. So combining all of these candlesticks together is how we can start to actually determine market direction and determine trend and also determine structure levels such as support and resistance. And these are going to all be foundational parts of success in any trading career on any market. Understanding how to read a candlestick chart is the foundation of any good trading strategy. All right. So we have a starting point down here. Correct. This market pushed up from this level with a nice impulsive move indicating a lot of buyers coming in from that direction. Now what we're looking for next is to see if that level is broken. So we have a high. And when I say hi, this time, I'm not talking about the high of a single candlestick. I'm talking about the high that's represented by the combination of candlesticks throughout this impulsive move up, which was right here. The high is what's created before the pullback. So this pullback represents people selling from the market, a combination of people selling. And the reason they're selling can be because of many different factors. Some people that were in down here at this level that we started from are now just taking profit. Other people may be jumping in based on some type of fundamental news release or based on some type of technical analysis. But all of that is really irrelevant information because all we want to do is look at the chart and understand what it's doing. So once we've created that high, we're looking for a pullback and then the creation of a new high. This three point move is how we can start to determine market direction. Once we have this three point move, a low to a high to a pullback or higher low to a new high, once that's created, then we can determine that the market direction is currently up. The market direction is bullish. And with that being the case, we have the ability to restrict ourselves to only bullish trades to only long trades. And this can really be beneficial to a trading strategy. Now what are we looking for after this three point move? This is where a lot of traders get confused. Well, we're looking for this uptrend to continue before the break of our support level. This is our support level. So before this support level gets broken, we expect the market to come up and break above this resistance level and continue our uptrend. And that's exactly what we get. Here we have this pullback again, selling pressure from taking profit, from traders taking positions based on fundamental news events and traders taking positions based on technical analysis. And then we have another push up continuing our uptrend because we've now broken above our previous high. And since we have a break above our previous high into a new high, what are we expecting? We're expecting another new high and we're expecting it before the break of this support level right here. Now some main places that we can expect this market to turn around while in this uptrend are our previous points of resistance, which would be represented by this and this. That's a spot where the market is likely to continue its trend to the upside or we could look at other support and resistance levels through this zone as likely zones for the market to continue its trend. Other examples of that would be right in here because that level has acted as resistance before. And even this lower level represented by our blue line, any of those levels are highly likely places for the market to continue in its uptrend or in its current trend, which for the moment on the pound Aussie here is up. So we're going to continue determining market direction like this and guys, it's important to remember that no matter how you're determining market direction, it's never going to be 100 percent accurate. But doing this and creating rules for determining trend is going to keep you consistent when it comes to placing trades and that's what's very, very important when trading in any market. So now we have this pullback yet again, a high, a pullback and what do we get a new high? The market's going into a new high now. We'll wait on that pullback. There we go. We're starting to have a pullback now. So we'll draw our line yet again. And what are we waiting for at this point? Well, we're waiting for the market to break above this high before we break below this lower support level right here. Let's see what we get. Market pushing down, pushing down. Okay. Now look on this edge of the screen and you can see that we have a break and close below that support level. So let's use those same rules and let's determine trend based on this candlestick chart. Based on this candlestick chart, we've now created a reversal. We've now broken the structure support level that we were looking at before. Since we've done that, we expect this market to trade lower now instead of higher. So now our bullish direction bias, our long bias is gone completely. We're no longer looking for this market to head higher than our previous level. We're now waiting for a pullback and a break below the newly created support level, which is going to be right here. So now that we have this newly created support level and we're starting on this pullback, we're going to be waiting for the market to give us a reason to go short. And then we're waiting for a breaking close below this previous support level. So this is how you can determine market direction using these candlestick charts. Guys, pointing out these highs and lows and waiting for the market to tell you whether or not it's going to be supported by that support level or continue in that current trend or if it's going to reverse like what we just saw. And guys, there's no need for an indicator on the chart for me to know this information. I don't need moving averages. I don't need an RSI indicator to tell me that this market wanted to reverse right there. I've determined that information based solely on these candlestick charts. And I'm showing you guys how to do the same exact thing. So now that we've created this downtrend, remember we talked about this at the beginning of the section of the video, we're waiting on this one, two, three move. We have a low, a lower high, and then a lower low created. This is telling us now we're in a downtrend. Now we can expect this market to continue in this downward direction. Let's see what happens. We get this small pullback and then we do continue in the downward direction right there. So we got that small pullback, continuation down, another pullback, and another continuation down. And now we're still continuing this trend and expecting this market to create lower lows. So we continue taking a look at this market. As you can see, we're dropping down now. And now beginning to rally. Still in this trend, guys, I want to make sure I make that a clear point. I'll go ahead and take this line off so it doesn't get confusing. Until the market breaks this level of resistance right here, I am considering this market in a downtrend. These are just the rules that I've created to personally identify trend. So we have this pullback again pushing up towards our resistance level, but not breaking it. So still we're in this downtrend and now we're pushing even lower. And here we are at current day and currently this market's pushed up. So right now, guys, we're just in this period of consolidation on the pound Aussie. So looking at this area in through here as our consolidation area. Now on this specific timeframe, because of this consolidation, we see that doesn't mean that I'm going to be looking for a bearish trade. When I see markets that look like this, I just avoid them altogether until the market shows me what it wants to do. Until the market shows me it's going to continue this downtrend by breaking below. Then after the market shows me what it wants to do, I'll look for my next opportunity to go short or another possibility is that this market pushes up and breaks above our resistance level. And in that case, I'll be looking for a new long opportunity. So when markets start to consolidate like this, I just wait for the market to tell me what direction it wants to go. Another thing that's very important and can be very beneficial to trading strategies. And guys, I am considering producing a video that will explain multiple timeframe analysis and which timeframes you should pay the most attention to when it comes to structure levels and trend. And what I'm going to do is when this video gets 500 likes, that's when I'll produce the multiple timeframe video, because I want to make sure there's enough people that are interested in that topic before I do so.
