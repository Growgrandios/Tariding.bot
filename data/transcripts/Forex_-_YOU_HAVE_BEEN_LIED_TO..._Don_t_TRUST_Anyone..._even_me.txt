See you soon Welcome back, so let me go ahead and explain a little bit about what today's video is gonna be at the beginning I'm gonna go through why you should not be blindly trusting a Mentor even if you're paying them even if it's me even if you're just watching them for free on YouTube No matter what a mentor or a guru that's teaching you how to trade you can't blindly trust them We're gonna explain that one of the biggest lessons that helped me Overcome the hurdle of losing money was understanding that I can't blindly trust people because they don't have the same mindset I have right and also after that I'm actually gonna break down the top five major pairs we're gonna go over our analysis from last week talk about what's happened Since then and give you what I think is coming in the future for the top five major pairs. So let's begin like this most traders Whenever they either hire a guru a mentor They they hire someone to help them on their trading journey or just wandering around YouTube They find someone they like and they trust Then they take that information and instead of Taking a mentor's advice There's there's a big difference between blindly trusting someone and listening to them and taking their advice taking their advice is totally fine Whether it's from me or someone else you watch for free here on YouTube or someone Let's say that you're paying for mentorship It's totally fine to take their advice right if they tell you that that entire strategy entire rules-based Strategy that they use and have used for years to make money in the market I'm not saying that they're wrong and I'm not saying that you can't take that advice and and listen to them What I'm saying is you should not blindly trust Anyone including me and here's the reason if you take something that I say and you blindly trust that it works and you go out into the markets and you use it Let's say I tell you to always trade at a support level or always go short at resistance levels And you just go out and blindly start trading that You have no proof. You are literally just throwing money away. You're throwing For lack of a better term shit at the wall and hoping that it sticks and that's not gonna create a professional trading career The way you take the blindfold off instead of blindly trusting someone and just take their advice is when someone tells you something become a tester become a mad scientist and test Everything that someone tells you and this is something I instill in traders, especially in the EAP training program in the mentorship program We have I tell them from the very beginning look take the advice I'm giving you with a grain of salt until you actually take and test it in the markets So I live by this in my own coaching programs I live by this in my own trading if I go out here and I find a Strategy I like that someone else is using I don't just take and start trading it most traders do that's what leads to a lot of traders blowing Accounts and if it's it's something that's been hurting your trading leave a comment below and let me know Because what I see from a lot of the traders that come through the program We have and something that I struggled with myself is that traders end up going through the program that they're in not even ours Going through a different program blindly trusting the strategy without ever testing it without ever Trusting it for themselves I don't know if you know what I mean It's better to trust yourself than it is to trust someone else and if you go out and test something that someone tells you that creates trust in you What's gonna create confidence and that's gonna be how you deal with drawdowns down the road whenever you become a professional trader The way you're gonna deal with drawdowns is by trusting yourself and trusting what you're trading and in order to do that You can't just take somebody's word for it That's not gonna create the trust you need to battle through those drawdowns So again with traders a lot of times what they do is they they find a guru they like and they just start blindly trading based on what that guru said and not to mention the fact that Let me start like this the entire reason I wanted to do this video is because I was watching a trading tutorial from another Guru another mentor another guy online that was teaching how to trade and I'm not gonna name names or anything like that but he was talking in very vague terminology and There were people on there that on this this live call you had that we're starting to Ask questions. He didn't know the answer to and instead of telling them the answer He would say it just comes with experience. It just comes with experience and that's totally fine But what happens is the half the traders that were on this call after the call Probably went out and started trading blindly based on this guy's methods And that's something that resonated with me so well because that's something I'm so scared of not only for you But something I dealt with in the beginning of my trading career was just going out here and blindly trading based on these strategies and Something that really irked me was that this guy was showing only winning trades of the strategy and claiming It was like a 90% win rate and then showing you a chart that was trending right all that was doing was trending Showing you a piece of a chart that was just trending the whole time and that is a surefire signal that you don't need to necessarily Blindly trust that person. I'm not saying the strategy was wrong or that the guy was lying I have no idea. I'm not gonna use the strategy so I didn't go out and test it myself But if I was going to use that specific strategy, I wouldn't take that guy's word Blindly and just go out here and start trading it Which is what he was actually suggesting people do as well, which is a whole another conversation also a very terrible thing to do but don't don't take anyone's word for the profitability of a system or strategy they're trading or Even the kind of technical analysis they do you can test different versions of technical analysis as well You can test how many times price reacts to resistance levels throughout historical data How many times has that happened and at this point? I'm rambling a bit. That's one of the biggest lessons that helped me Get past the point of losing money in the forex market was understanding that I needed to test everything and trust no one again Taking advice from a mentor is totally different than blindly trusting them And what I'm asking you to do is to not blindly trust anyone here on YouTube Anyone that you're paying for education don't blindly trust them become a mad scientist Test the information they tell you for yourself again This is something I instill in every person that goes through our programs in the very beginning in the very beginning They know not to blindly trust everything but instead to go test it for themselves That's one of the biggest lessons I wanted you to know and wanted to teach you in this video I hope it resonates and I hope you actually take it and use it beyond that we are going to take a look at last week's Analysis and how that analysis is played out this week on the top five major pairs So last week, I'll show you a video active video clip of the euro dollar from last week right now So check that out and I'll be right back with this being another scenario So with another scenario being the market breaks through this level of structure Right here because if that's the case then this black line You see it's going to be an area look for a pullback and a shorting opportunity from but let's go ahead and move on So this may be a little bit hard to see but only euro dollar as you saw in that clip We had an estimation that this market if we broke and closed below this area of support our green line Then we could potentially see a pullback back into this zone right here and from that zone We would be looking for a possible shorting opportunity out of the euro dollar as you can see right here That's exactly what happened and although this doesn't look like much on a daily chart and trades like this I normally look for around a hundred pips and this trade itself moved about a hundred and fifty so this is actually a hundred and fifty-pit drop from the point that we We we recognized last week in last week's analysis and really at this point The only thing we're gonna do is remove this line. Nothing else has changed here on the euro dollar if we We have a couple of different scenarios now at this point It looks like we have this double bottom here We could possibly see this market push up when that happens if that happens We're gonna look for that push up to come into our previous resistance level here And we'll be looking at 1.1211 for possible shorting opportunities here on the euro dollar beyond that if we break above that level We'll be looking at 1.1280 for the next level of possible resistance out of the euro dollar now if we push down on this pair Our support level from last week still exists around 1.0858 that the level will be looking for possible long opportunities Counter trend because this is market that's in a downtrend at the moment So as a counter trend play that's gonna be an area We take a look at and we'll have to scroll the chart back because I always like having two areas We talked about that last week that video will be in the description as well if you didn't see it But I like having two separate areas of resistance and two separate areas of support that I'm paying attention to and at this point what I'm seeing is another area of support Right in here. I'm pointing that out because we have one two tests of resistance here in this area and Actually a third test right here And that gives me the qualifications I need to call this a major level support that I'll be looking for possible counter trend opportunities at that level and I had a comment last week that levels aren't lines. I know that I know these are zones So this zone is going to be around the 1.0766 level get creative It's a zone not a line. So remember this is going to be a box Like this and if we break past our 1.08 58 level and get down to 1.07 6 then that's an area I'll be looking at for counter trend long opportunities out of the euro dollar So next up we have the dollar yen our prediction last week on this pair was that we were looking for This market to possibly break above our red zone if we did we would be looking for a pullback into that zone And another push higher. That's what we are still looking for the analysis from last week on this pair is still relevant So at this point on this pair we're waiting for this market either to climb all the way up to 108.87 if we climb up to that level It's a level I'll look for possible shorting opportunities from trying to get about a hundred pips out of this Maybe some trend continuation to the downside we are in a in a downtrend overall Although we did just break above the 50 period moving average and we broke through this little level of consolidation But overall still in a downtrend currently on this pair and if we get that move it's gonna be an area I look for some possible a large push down from the 108.87 level place I'll probably take like multiple targets on the trade looking for that and Beyond that if we go above that level and put another horizontal line at a level of possible resistance Looks like we're gonna come in right in there if we scroll this back Yeah, right there seems to be an area of the market as respected multiple times in the past as support and as resistance And it's going to be the next level that I pay attention to for possible shorting opportunities on the dollar yen If we get up past 108.87 we have a long ways to go and during this long ways to go Which is what I'm referring to it as it's gonna be an area I start looking for trend continuation plays on lower time frames flag patterns and such until we get up to 110.75 at 110.75 will be an area I look for possible Short trades to the downside on the dollar yen So moving on now to the next pair which is going to be the Aussie dollar only Aussie dollar We had an area of resistance pointed out last week, which is still intact right now We're waiting to see what happens in this area for this market. We have a nice long wicks candle here And this area was at 0.6856 again These are zones so that zone looks something like this and this zone is currently holding as resistance We'll see what happens going through the week. This is a zone I'm currently looking for possible short trades out of what I'd really like to see and I'll actually go down to an hourly chart and show you this What I'd really like to see is this market breakthrough our bottom line here So if we can get a breakthrough this level of support and then a pullback into it That will be a time I start looking for shorting opportunities on this particular trade because we just bounced off a daily level of resistance So if we're bouncing off a daily level of resistance and we get a nice one two three move to the downside This first move down after that this pullback up that comes into this support level and gives me a candlestick pattern Such as a shooting star candle or something like that That'll be an area I'm paying attention to in a trade that I will more than likely be taking here on the Aussie dollar But other than that last week's analysis it remains exactly the same We're at our resistance level if we push above it the next resistance we have is 0.6942 That's the next level I'll look for possible shorting opportunities if the market falls We'll be looking down here at 0.6679 and I'm not even gonna discuss the level below this because there's no way We make it there without some kind of dramatic event within the next week or two But those are the levels only all Z dollar I'm paying attention to we'll move on now to the pound dollar Pound dollar nearing the resistance level that we had for this pair last week We still haven't quite got there. We have remember it's a zone. We have gotten into the zone though So we've actually clipped our zone here on the pound dollar. We've had some movement to the downside Let's see if it's been a hundred pips. That's what normally what I look for out of these zones We've had about 96 pips at this point from our zone on the pound dollar We can still look there or at least I will still be looking there for possible resistance If we get another pullback up into that area and for another possible trade to the downside If we get above that area though, I'll be looking around 1.2489 for possible resistance and if this market just suddenly drops I'll be looking at our zone between 1.204 and 1.199 for possible long opportunities out of this pair That's what I'll be looking for going into this week and next week on the pound dollar Lastly we have the dollar Swiss on the dollar Swiss We had this level pointed out at 0.9915 last week This zone of resistance that started at 0.9929. We have seen some resistance out of that level so far this week We'll see if that continues to play out if it does I'll be looking on lower time frames for possible train continuation trades down to 0.9841 and 0.9816 in this zone will be an area I look for possible long trades If the market pushes up and breaks our level we're currently sitting at then I'll be looking for the 1.0 area And this is on in this area for possible shorting opportunities out of the dollar Swiss And I really like this being an even handled number being a one like 1.0 That's going to be a very significant place in this market in my opinion and it's a level I hope the market gets up to so I can get a possible shorting opportunity from that area That's what I'll be paying attention to on the dollar Swiss and that's all for this video I hope that you enjoyed it.
