Hey guys and welcome to the trading channel and welcome to today's video today's video We're gonna be talking about a pretty big trade we had on the dollar Swiss last week that we discussed in structure-based trading Episode 8 if you'd like to see that video you can do so by clicking the link in the description this trade managed to bank in around 108 pips in just two days and what I'm gonna do today is discuss with you guys the Announces that we used in the EAP in order to get involved in this trade and today We're also gonna talk a little bit about not only the importance of a great trading strategy in your trading plan But also the importance of good trading psychology and discipline Those are the two major things you will need to become profitable So if you're struggling with either of those things then make sure to keep it locked here through the intro and disclaimer And I'll be right back on the other side Welcome back traders, so before we get into today's analysis if you would like to be alerted When I come out with other free educational content here on YouTube then make sure you click the subscribe button in the bottom right hand side Of your screen now also before we get started looking at the analysis behind this dollar Swiss trade What I'd like to do is show you guys an email that I got from a long time EAP member Yesterday, so let's take a look at that email first Here if you'll read along with me it says dear Steven I really want to thank you for all the videos you've made put up They really taught me a lot about the markets. It wasn't an easy journey But with a lot of hard work and with your help I am now a profitable trader Now guys, how do you think? That this trader was able to accomplish this The main reason he was able to accomplish this comes in these two words Hard work Trading is not easy guys It's not something that's gonna come natural to most people and it takes more than just a good strategy And it also takes more than just good psychology takes more than a good teacher or mentor A lot of it comes down to the effort that you are willing to put forth in your trading So going back to the beginning of the video as I said today We're gonna talk a little bit about how you need good strategies along with discipline in your trading plan in order to become profitable Consistently and successful in the forex market and that's something that the trader I just showed you was able to accomplish now. Let's take this trade for example here on the dollar Swiss We were able to get an entry in this trade Right around this previous daily level support So we have in the EAP a set of Conditions and entry reasons that we use in order to create a strategy And this is a strategy that I've tested in the markets in the past and proven to be profitable for me now again This is not the only thing you need if you have a great strategy that produces a ton of pips every year Yet you have no discipline in your trading then every time you go through a drawdown You're gonna try to switch strategies and you're gonna end up losing money in the long run So it's not enough just to have a good strategy now vice versa if you have a great amount of discipline and the best trading Psychology that anyone has ever heard of yet You have a strategy that does not give you an edge over the market. You have a strategy that does not produce you with profit Then you're gonna trade yourself right into an empty bank account So both are necessary guys and discussing why discipline is important brings me to another good point Many traders go to the markets and find a strategy Possibly the same kind of strategy that we use and for example Let's say the same kind of strategy that we used here to get involved in this trade here on the dollar Swiss So if we trade this time and that trade works out then we get a move higher and a similar trade So right here and we decide to take it now if the market pushes up and hits our target Of course, that's a great trade But the problem with most traders is that if this happens again say we get the same exact thing a push above and a pullback In an entry reason and all the above we get the same exact strategy here, but instead This time it looks something more like this And does not hit targets What's gonna happen to most traders most traders see this and unfortunately they think that just because the strategy lost or maybe we do this Two times in a row. Let's say we pushed back up and then eventually did the same thing again Now after this trade, what do you think's happening in the mind of a trader with no discipline? After losing these two trades in a row they consider this strategy trash They consider it as something that doesn't work anymore and what they're actually gonna do is Move on to another strategy and then now they're gonna start trading Counter-trend double bottoms now. They're gonna start trading double tops in the middle of nowhere They're just gonna move on to a separate strategy and then that strategy is gonna do the same thing Eventually that strategy is gonna lose two three four Maybe even five or six trades in a row and when it does if you don't have discipline in the strategy that you're trading You're just gonna keep switching strategies when in reality guys Just because a strategy loses a few times in a row that doesn't mean that it's not a successful strategy That doesn't mean that you're not gonna be profitable over the course of a year And that does not mean that you don't have an edge over the market majority of strategies Have times when they lose in a trader with the right mindset Proper risk management and proper discipline in his trading is going to be able to handle and fight through those drawdowns In order to make it the new equity has eventually in his account now as I said all these things have to come together this specific trader must also Have a strategy that's been back tested in the market and that he knows is profitable Otherwise it will be nearly impossible to be disciplined to a strategy and although past performance does not necessarily Indicate future results. It is the only thing we have to go by in the market So one of the only ways I've found to actually have discipline and have confidence in a trading strategy is through back and forward testing Before you start trading live because what happens is if you start trading live before doing those things you are unprepared For the drawdowns that are inevitable you're unprepared for that four or five trade losing streak And when you're watching your real hard-earned money Fade away throughout that four or five trade losing streak then it will be very difficult for you to stay disciplined to that trading strategy And that brings me to another point guys another thing that I see out of a lot of traders is False expectations and what I mean by that is everyone's out there looking for the strategy that doesn't lose everyone's out there looking for the strategy That makes them 500 percent a year and it's much more likely that you find a strategy that gives you a slight edge over the market We must remember that having an edge over the market at all is already extremely difficult So even if we have a slight edge over the market like a strategy that wins 55 Of the time with a one to one and a half to one risk reward that is giving us an edge over the market Just because it's not making you 500 to a thousand percent a year does not mean that it can't be a successful strategy And so especially for beginner traders, I think it's very important To take a strategy and even if it only gives you a slight edge over the market Go ahead and get your feet wet by forward testing that strategy to see if it's something you can execute So the number one point in today's video is going to be remember that it takes a good strategy along with great You're trading to become profitable. Number two point is remember don't have too high of expectations So the last point in this video before we move on to discussing the analysis behind this trade is going to be remember To be patient in your process to becoming profitable Patience is key guys. You want to be patient before you even put your live money in the market Make sure you're profitable in a demo account before you go live and not only profitable in a demo account But you're profitable in a demo account using a strategy That you have in your trading plan Don't just go out here and trade blindly and be profitable in a demo account and think that you're going to get into live markets and do the same thing It's a whole different beast once you get into a live market. So that was the final point on my discipline psychology and strategy rent Now let's go ahead and dive deeper into the analysis behind the dollar Swiss trade and guys quickly before we get into that If you're somebody that's struggling with some of the things we've talked about here today And you would like to speed up your process and learn some of the strategies that I use and how I back tested those strategies in order to speed up your Process of becoming a profitable and professional trader along with receive three to five email analysis trades per week So that you can see a professional trader Going through drawdown and coming out of it on the other side in order to speed up your process of becoming disciplined in the market Then I've left a link in the description below along within the top right hand corner of the screen to the training program We run here at the trading channel called the ea peep and that program will help you with all of the things we've discussed here So now let's go ahead and dive into the dollar Swiss analysis and guys This is just analysis that we've talked about here at the trading channel multiple times. We're looking at these previous daily levels of structure And trend we're we're reading trend from these levels. So what we had was a previous level of daily structure that was touched multiple times here here and here And then if we drop down to our smaller time frame down on the four hour chart, you can see that we had a break above that level Now that was not all we needed. We had a break above that level plus this market had reversed trend meaning We had a break of this resistance this resistance And this resistance Now at the time many people were bearish the dollar yet. We still went long. Why did we do that? Discipline in our trading guys Discipline in our trading we knew that this was a strategy that based on the rules we've learned We knew at the trading channel that this strategy based on the rules we have in the ea pee Was a good trade. So although everyone was bearish on the dollar at that time We traded this anyway and the reason is because we were staying disciplined to our trading plan And that's one of the most important things in your trading. So after this break and close above this level This level and this level showing us that this market could possibly continue higher We waited for a pullback A simple pullback guys and waiting for that pullback it ran all the way down into that daily level of structure Which we knew was going to be a powerful level Now we didn't necessarily know that this market was going to push off this level and go up But according to the back testing data we have from the strategy we used here on the dollar swiss More often than not when the market pulls back to the daily structure levels and puts in the entry reasons that we use the ea pee We do get a nice bounce Enough to hit the targets that we place and that's exactly what happened here In last week's structure based trading video We pointed out that this level of structure would be where we would be managing the position to take off second targets And what i'm going to do is just play you guys a small clip from that video Really quickly and then i'll be right back to continue this analysis And the reason we're looking at that level as resistance is because if you look back here in the past We've used this level the market has used this level as resistance a couple of times there along with right there So that's going to be a place we plan to manage this position meaning that's going to be a place where if the market gets to that level We will be considering taking off second targets of the current position We're in on the dollar swiss and also that'll be a place where we're looking for So as you saw in that video guys, we were looking at the 0.976 level for targets on the second part of this position And that's exactly what we did we pushed right into that level Barely hit our targets for around 108 pips And the more his sense has pushed down a little bit from that daily level of resistance So guys just to go over what we discussed in the video One more time Remember that it's not only a great strategy that'll make you a profitable trader It comes down to discipline and being able to control your emotions while trading to keep from making mistakes Remember that you don't need to be making 500 to a thousand percent a year to be a profitable and professional trader a slight edge over the market Is all you need a slight advantage? And lastly remember guys, it's important to be patient be patient before you ever even get in the market with a lot of money I have a video talking about becoming a successful trader that actually talks a lot on patience And what i'll do is link that in the top right in quarter screen and in the description below Again guys if these things that we've discussed in this video Are something that you have had trouble with in your trading then feel free to check out that eap training program If you have any questions then make sure to leave them in the comments section below If you're new and you enjoyed the content make sure to hit like and subscribe to be alerted next time We come out with stuff like this here on youtube If you want more free educational content for me that I don't produce here on youtube then head over to the trading channel dot net And sign up for our email list and doing so will also get you one of my own Potential trade setups each week.
