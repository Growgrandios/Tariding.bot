While you do that, I'm going to let the intro and disclaimer roll, and I'll see you guys on the other side to share my predictions for these top 5 major pairs. Welcome back guys. Let's start off today's analysis on the euro dollar. So first off, let's take a look at trend like we always do here in these weekly market prediction videos. What's the trend of the euro dollar? Well currently, if we look at recent price action, what we're seeing is a period of consolidation out of this market. So something that's important to note is that at times that there's not a trend, it's okay if you look at a chart and say, I do not know which direction this market's going to go based on what I'm seeing right now. That's going to happen from time to time during your trading. And the euro dollar is in one of those situations. We have a market that was pushing up in an uptrend. And let me give you guys the actual rules that I used to define a market in a period of consolidation. So we had this uptrend creating new highs and new lows. What happened here is the market broke above this previous resistance. As soon as that break happened, when I had pointed out my previous level of support before that resistance break and the highest level of resistance the market made it do. Now anything the market does bouncing around in between these two lines we have on our screen, our previous support level and our highest resistance level made is going to be consolidation. This will be consolidation according to my analysis until we either get a breakout to the upside, continuing our previous uptrend or a break lower, putting us into a reversal situation and giving us an indication that we could possibly see the start of a downtrend. So that's what we're looking at here on the daily chart on the euro dollar. Now does that mean that we have no trading opportunities at all? Well, I can tell you one thing. We're definitely not looking for long opportunities. Why do I say that? Well, because we just pushed off this previous level of support and we've already had over a 200 pip move from that level pushing up. So we're not chasing this thing on a by expecting the 1.2513 level to be retested again. The markets already tried to push above that level three times, which honestly gives me a slight bias to the downside. So that being the case, looking at a smaller timeframe and seeing that this market on a smaller timeframe actually gave me enough of an indication that we were in a downtrend on that timeframe. And what I'm talking about is the four hour chart one time frame down from this chart we're on now. My initial thoughts this week for the euro dollars, we actually see some type of pullback at least retesting this zone in here between our blue line and these previous lows the market created. So that's initially what I'm looking for out of the euro dollar is a pullback into that area before we either see this market break into a possible reversal situation or if we see this market hit this area and start to push up finding support here yet again at these previous lows. So initially again looking for this pullback looking for it to get in between the area of 1.2246 all the way down to these lows really 1.2150 anywhere in that zone somewhere we could potentially see some type of long setup and take it as a support bounce trade. Now the market may not respect that analysis and it could continue up higher if it does than 1.2513 is definitely somewhere we'll be looking for possible shorting opportunities and above that at 1.2608 if we get a little bit higher there. This market heads lower of course our first zone is right in between our blue line and the previous low there that we'll be looking for possible long opportunities and if we push below that creating this possible. Trend reversal going into a downtrend will be looking for shorting opportunities all the way down to the 1.2040 level which will be the next level we look at for possible long opportunities here on the euro dollar. So that's our analysis for this pair again pair or stock or whatever you trade in a period of consolidation and looking at the charts not really knowing or understanding which direction we're likely to go is completely okay you're not always going to know or always going to have your rules met to be able to follow a specific trend no doubt recent price action has given us a period of consolidation here in the euro dollar which can make determining which direction this market is going to go extremely difficult. So that's what we have here on the euro dollar next up we're going to be taking a look at the dollar in. So here on the dollar in last week we had predictions of this market continuing in a downtrend not actually put a little clip of last week's video up right over here and what we were looking at last week is this market being in a downtrend. We were looking lower with lower lows and lower highs and we said that we expected this right here this pullback we had to be our lower high. We expected this to be our lower low that to be our lower high and trend continuation out of this market we expect this market start creating new lower lows fall by another lower high until the market breaks into a reversal breaking previous resistance. So what we now have is a market that has created a new lower low we have not closed below this low yet though so we haven't officially put ourselves into a continuation of this downtrend but instead of that we bounced off this level of support with a little bit of buying pressure out of the market. Now something that's important to note what I'm doing these videos and I'm pointing out the levels of major structure and trends in these markets if you are a trend continuation trader then you really don't need to be paying attention to these counter trend levels of support I'm pointing out and the reason why is because look at this massive downtrend the dollar ends in. If you're a trend continuation trader you just need to be looking at that trend and trying to find a way to jump on that trend and all these lines are going to make that a little bit confusing so what I'm going to do is actually open up a different chart very mean just a second and here we have the same dollar in chart as I know it's a different background I'm sorry about that but this is going to make it a little easier for you to see the trend I'm talking about without the horizontal lines we had on the screen so in this trend what we're looking at is lower lows and lower highs being created we have this lower low followed by this which looks to be our lower high and if we actually get a close below this level sometime this week say this candle comes down and closes below that level then that's putting us into trend continuation for this downtrend meaning that if you're a trend continuation trader you don't really need to be looking any lower than that like if we have a major level of structure pointed out at 104.5 if that was the case you would not need to be looking at that level for trading opportunities that's a counter trend trade and if you are a trading continuation trader what you need to be looking for is that pullback and a way to jump on the underlying trend is that if you are just starting to trade I would really suggest only picking one either trading continuation or counter trend trades and if you've picked trading continuation trades to be your trading style then when we're looking at these major levels of support while the market's in a downtrend you really don't need to pay attention to those levels of support for trading opportunities so with that being said let's go ahead and go back over to the dollar in on this chart and talk about what we're expecting next out of this pair well as I said we did have a nice push off of this level of support the only way I'll be looking for a trading opportunity here at 105.65 is if we get a nice retest probably a double bottom on a lower time frame possibly some RSI divergence along with some other entry techniques that we use in the EAP training program this will have to be a really good entry if I'm looking for trading opportunities at this level and the reason is because what we just talked about we have a massive downtrend on this market that I really don't want to trade against so a better scenario for me this week would be a push below these lows and a pullback into the 105.65 level making that resistance pushing down I will be looking for counter trend long opportunities around 103.93 if the market gets down to that level and if we end up going a little bit higher from here without pushing below and breaking below these previous lows the first place I'll be looking at for resistance and trade continuation is around 107.46 if we go higher than that around 108.70 since our predictions here on the dollar in now we'll go ahead and move on to our next pair which is going to be the Aussie dollar okay guys so on the Aussie dollar here last week the market was hovering around this major level of resistance at 0.7893 we said that we expected this market to continue in the downward direction from this level again there'll be a clip right over here showing you guys that analysis from last week now that we've pushed into trading continuation here and what I mean by that is we've had a market that was previously in an uptrend making these new highs then we have this very impulsive move down that breaks below our previous level of support this would be our initial low afterwards we get our lower high and since then we've gotten a new lower low because of this we know we're now in a downtrend and we can expect some trading continuation out of this pair what's the first place that we're going to be looking for for trading continuation now the Aussie dollar we're looking to get a pullback up into 0.7806 that would be the first place we look for trading continuation out of this pair we can also be looking for some possible counter-trained opportunities to the long side if we get a push back down to 0.7730 in that area as a level we can look for possible long opportunities on the Aussie dollar now if we get a push above our most previous support level that we expect to become resistance and the market puts in the lower high a little bit higher than we expect in the next place for resistance we'll look at is 0.7893 for trading continuation out of the Aussie dollar so again initially our very first prediction out of the Aussie dollar is hopefully we get some kind of push up into this level of previous support looking left that is now going to possibly become resistance at 0.7806 and in that levels we're looking for our first trading continuation shorting opportunities now let's go ahead and move on to our next pair our next pair today is going to be the pound dollar so here on the pound dollar we have our 1 2 3 possible reversal move what do I mean by that well we have this push down followed by a lower high and a lower low we ended up getting a break in close below this previous low putting us into a possible reversal situation as we were in an uptrend here on the pound dollar because this my initial prediction here on the pound dollars to go ahead and turn this line to red for resistance and right where the market is now for me is going to be a great place start looking for some shorting opportunities out of the pound dollar what I'm expecting this to be is our push down to a lower low this becoming our lower high quite possibly and then pushing us down into trading continuation right below this previous low if we get that trading continuation the next place we'll be looking for long opportunities is 1.3597 and if the market instead of finding resistance at the 1.3856 like we expect continues higher we'll be looking left right around 1.40 9 1 for our next level of possible resistance here on the pound dollar but initially our expectations is for this market to actually find some resistance in this zone where we are currently and if we get that right kind of entry reason in this zone that's what we'll be doing is taking this market short and expectation of trading continuation following the last two impulsive moves down and again for support 1.3597s can be a good level we'll go ahead and zoom the chart out take a look at one more level for support can you guys spot a major level yet right there's the next major level of support that I see reason being because this is a level in the market that was tested as resistance a few times in the past as well as support more recently right in there so around 1.3450 will be another level that if the market does push down in some trading continuation that we'll be looking forward for possible long opportunities here out of the pound dollar now let's go ahead and move on to our final pair which will be the dollar Swiss so last week on this dollar Swiss pair we talked about the 0.9464 level is being possible resistance we thought this was an area that would push the market down with some selling pressure and I'll put a screenshot of that right over here on your screen now why do we expect this well because if you look here similar to our dollar in analysis we are still in this massive downtrend we had this big impulsive move down to this low right here we had a pullback to a lower high a push down to a lower low now because of that what are we expecting a new lower high or in this case an equal high and then trend continuation we're still expecting trend continuation to the downside out of the dollar Swiss based on our technical analysis here on the daily chart so with that being the case what we're expecting in our initial prediction for this week is for this market to push back up into 0.9464 if we get that push up into that level that's somewhere we definitely will be taking a look at for possible shorting opportunities here on the dollar Swiss now if this market continues lower from where we are now say we get this next impulsive move down all the way back down to 0.9274 although we are still currently in a downtrend on this pair we can look at that level for a possible counter trend long opportunity for those of you who are counter trend traders and if we push below that these most previous lows looking at 0.91 904 will be a really good spot for counter trend opportunities as well so pretty simple analysis here on the dollar Swiss our initial prediction is that if we get a move back up into 0.9464 we can look there for possible shorting opportunities so that's going to do it for today's video guys that's our predictions on the dollar Swiss our predictions on
