On the screen in front of you, you can see a hammer and a shooting star candle. And the way I define these in order to keep myself consistent and never second guess whether I'm actually seeing a hammer or a shooting star candle is by utilizing a Fibonacci retracement tool. So I take my Fibonacci retracement tool from the low of the candlestick, up to the high of the candlestick, and as long as the entire body of the candlestick is above the 38.2% retracement, which is my little blue line here, then I have what I consider a valid hammer candle. And it's the opposite for a shooting star candle. For a shooting star candle, I'm looking from the high of the candle down to the low of the candle and as long as the entire body of the candle is in fact below the 38.2% retracement, then I count that as a shooting star candle. So hopefully that gives you some more clarity on what I mean by having set and stone rules for the candlestick pattern you're using. That way you can stay consistent and you're never second guessing whether or not the candlestick pattern you're trying to use is actually there on the chart.
