So traders we just opened up a position we have a lab position going here on the Aussie dollar 15 minute chart What we're gonna do today is break this trade down for you guys and tell you everything we use in order to get involved We're also gonna talk about three very important questions that you can use in order to predict with a high degree of accuracy Where a chart in any financial market is likely to go next these three questions are quite simple, but equally as important They consist of what? when and how After the intro and it's lame or me showing you guys exactly what I use to answer each of these questions and how I use these questions to help me I could really predict where a chart on any financial market is likely to go next So if that sounds interesting make sure you're subscribed here by clicking the button down below the video to the right-hand side and the notification Bell so that you're learning we come out with videos like this each and every week Make sure to click that like button for me while the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll be right back to discuss the what? When and how that we used in order to place this Aussie dollar trade All right guys So before we look at the Aussie dollar trade Let's take a look at the three questions We had to ask ourselves before placing that trade and the three questions we used in order to make the prediction that that market was going to continue in The downward direction the first question we discussed was what? And how are we going to determine the what of a market situation? Well, the way we determine that is by looking at the trend of the market What is going to be what is the market likely to do next and the way we determine that is looking at what it's done before And not only looking at what it's done before but having rules in place for trend that give us an advantage over the market So for instance, I know that with the rules I use for trend I have a 73% chance of a market Continuing in the direction of trend now the way I know that is because I've tested thousands of scenarios Using the rules that I have applied to trend trading I have tested thousands and thousands possibly tens of thousands of scenarios using these rules and they give me an advantage of around a 73% chance of a market continuing in trend now What I'm gonna do is actually share those rules with you here today So what are my rules for trend trading what I'm looking for for my what or for my trend is to see if a market is Breaking structured to the downside. We'll use a downtrend for this case after we break this level of structure support The rules that give me the 73% chance of continuing in trend or I'm waiting to see if this market pulls back up As long as we don't break and close above this previous resistance level right after the break, okay So we break that structure support level right after that break. I'm using this level of resistance as my last stand level If the market does not get up to this level and break and close above it No matter what it does in between here. I know that I have a 73% chance of this market continuing lower in trend Because of the rules I use and those are the exact rules I use for trend So with those rules being in place my what is always determined by the trend by the rules I have for trending markets Now, what's the next question? We have to ask ourselves after what the next question we ask ourselves is when right So after the what say the markets in a downtrend we ask ourselves when the answer to that question is well When are we expecting this market to continue down? If we know the what which is we're expecting the market to continue down then when are we expecting that? Well, the most likely scenario that we have is that this market either retests this structure support level or finds Resistance at its previous resistance levels these two levels are our win That would be our win right there Our win would be at this previous level of structure support if the market gets a little bit higher it'd be at the previous level of structure resistance So now we've got win taken care of and our final question we ask ourselves is how so we know What the market's done and it's likely to do we know when it's likely to do it Now we have to ask ourselves how how just it's going to stand for an entry reason of some kind that is testable in historical data And that we verified to give us an edge over the market So how is going to be the entry and guys mastering these three questions is what allows me to predict where markets are going to go with a High degree of accuracy what i'm going to do is use these three questions use this graph here We just drew out on the screen in order to show you the predictive analysis behind the allsy dollar trade So let's go ahead and go down to that trade let's lead all this And here we are on this allsy dollar trade now let's go ahead and ask ourselves those three questions Starting with what well the what is definitely a downtrend right especially the rules we just talked about remember we have this pushed down Pullback up and a break of structure support after this break of structure support We're looking right here. This is our Last stand level and as long as the market does not break above this last stand level and close above it Then we're expecting this market to continue in the downward direction now. What is our win? The answer to that question is previous structure support right we have this green box pointed out for that zone we were looking at We also have our previous structure resistance if this market goes any higher Now we have what answered we have when answered our final question is how How are we going to get involved? Well this market ended up putting in a really nice double top Right here at this area giving us our how and allowing us to place this trade Asking ourselves what when and how gave us the opportunity to place this specific trade and what i'm going to do is go ahead and pause the video Guys whether this trade wins or loses i'll come back after this trade is over We'll discuss a little bit more about the analysis and how we use these questions to create an advantage over the market For me, this will probably take a couple of hours in order for this trade to play out But for you with the power of editing it will be right now and just like that traders here We are with those first target wins on the aussie dollar What we had was this market coming up here was our double top as you can see this market did push up get close to stopping us out But then rolled over pushed down and hit our first targets our stop has since then been moved to break even We're waiting to see if this market can continue and trend to at least Retest this structure. Wow because we know we have a 73% chance of that happening based on the rules We use for structure before this market comes up and crosses above this resistance level looking left This is the systematic approach and the three questions we use to place a majority of the trading opportunities You see us take here at the trading channel. We always ask ourselves three separate questions beginning with what which is going to stand for the trend of the market That's how we will determine the what of the market by figuring out what it's done in the past What it's likely to do now? We're gonna look at the win when is it likely to continue and trend that is going to be Structure and last but not least we're gonna look at the how which is going to be the entry reason we've tested through historical data That gives us a edge over the market. So guys, these are the three questions We ask ourselves again almost every single time we place a trade adding these three questions Every time you place a trade can significantly improve the accuracy of the trades you take And of course trend structure and entry are not the only parts of trading There is a massive amount of more information you'll need in order to create success in this business and just like trend There are also very specific rules You need to be using for trend structure and entry if you would like to learn these specific entry rules The specific structure rules and the specific trend rules that we use here at the trading channel on a daily basis to place trades Then feel free to click the link in the description labeled eap training program to check out some more advanced training from us Also, we decided to extend one more time the free reversal training that we had going on a couple of weeks ago We had such great feedback from that free training that I want to extend it to you guys for seven more days So click the link in the description labeled free reversal training If you want to get your hands on that free strategy that teaches you a lot about trend structure and reversing markets Before you go go ahead and click that subscribe button If you're new to be alerted when we come out with more videos just like this If this was helpful to you make sure you go ahead and click that like button for me Make sure to share this video as well to help spread the word about what it's going to take to actually become a profitable trader I wish you guys the best of luck in all your future trades and I will talk to you You
