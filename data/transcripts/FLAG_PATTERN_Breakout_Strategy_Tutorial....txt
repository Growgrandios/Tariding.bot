Our entry on breakout patterns is just the candle that breaks and closes above the trend line of the breakout pattern. In this case, it's a flag pattern. And in this case, as I just pointed out, it would be this candle right here. We have momentum because the pullback did not touch the 50 EMA and we have consolidation due to multiple swing highs and low. We have our breakout candle right here. And after that, the first way of taking stops is by placing that stop loss below our previous swing low of the pattern. And the other way would be placing the stop loss right below the entry candle. And this way is going to give you a much better reward to risk ratio, whereas this way is a bit more conservative and may give you a little better of a win rate. Neither one of these ways works better or worse. It just depends on the currency pair, your trading and the market conditions at the time.
