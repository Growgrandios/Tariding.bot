Have you ever wondered what the value of a single PIP is? For example, if you buy the euro dollar and the price of the euro dollar goes up 20 PIPs How much money did you make? How much money does that translate into and the opposite happens? What if you buy the euro dollar and it goes down 20 PIPs? How much money did you lose? If you said I have no idea to those two questions then today we're going to fix that because being able to Calculate the value of each individual PIP is how we determine what we're going to lose and what we're going to make Own every trade we place because of that It is an essential part to trading success and without it You are bound to make tons of mistakes and end up going down the path of the 90 percent of traders that lose their accounts or either quit trading So let's go ahead and take care of this today And let me show you an essential part of trading success Which is how to calculate the value of a PIP I'm going to do that right after the intro and disclaimer before they roll though Click that subscribe button down below the video to the right hand side If you are interested in forex at all because we come out with free videos each and every week here on youtube Click that like button to help with the youtube algorithm and follow us on instagram at the trading channel I'll see you right after the intro and disclaimer Welcome to lesson number three on the basics of forex in this lesson We're going to talk about what you actually want in terms of trading how to calculate Profits and what you don't want in terms of trading how to calculate your losses and what I mean by this is what? That's a terrible w. We're going to restart this whole thing. Just kidding. We are going to restart with that w though. What is the value of a PIP So we know what the foreign exchange market is we know about currency pairs and we know what a PIP is But what is the actual value of that PIP to you and your trading because Well, you probably know this by now if a market moves up in PIPs If you buy in the market moves up in PIPs, then you're going to make money If you sell on the market goes down in PIPs, you're going to lose money But how do you calculate how much money that is? This is a question I get all the time How do I calculate my wins and my losses in forex and today in this video? Let's show you how to do is determine the value of a PIP. So how do we do this? Well for starters the value of a PIP depends highly on the amount of currency you're trading what that means is the amount of units that you're trading so in currency markets We're trading a set of units and these units normally come in four major Lot sizes four major sizes. So if you're trading Units of currency the what you want to what you want to actually look at And i'm going to do a graph for this Is the lot size in order to come up with the amount of value per PIP the amount of value each PIP is worth It depends on your trading lot size Or the amount of units that you're trading and those units again are broken down into Most of the time it's actually three major types, but we're going to do a fourth just in case The fourth one is one that's used very rarely, but you'll understand more about that in just a second Don't get confused nothing confusing about this what we're going to have in this column is the name Of whatever lot size you're doing what we're going to have in this column is the size And what we're going to have in this column is the value per PIP So value PP value per PIP in this in this last column And this is going to be the case for every pair that ends in USD It's going to be very similar. This is a generalization Every pair in the that ends in USD is going to be exactly to this scale Other currency pairs are going to vary but not by much this is a generalization This is a generalization But other currency pairs are not going to vary that much from this table the name of the first Size that is very common is a standard lot So we're going to label this SL that stands for a standard lot now if you're trading a standard lot that means you're trading 100 1000 Units of currency so if we're trading 100,000 units of currency on any pair that ends in USD Then this is the exact value per PIP If you have one standard lot that you're trading or if you're trading every 100,000 units you're trading You are trading at a value Of $10 per PIP So if you're trading a standard lot on the euro dollar That means that every PIP is $10 every PIP that it moves is $10 Let's go through the rest of the types of or size of units that you can do first And then we'll break into more about what they mean and how you can utilize them The second one is called a mini lot A mini lot means that you're controlling or holding 10,000 Units of a certain currency and with this being the case With 10,000 units of a currency you have a value per PIP of $1 So for every 10,000 units of a currency that you hold there is a value of $1 per PIP That's exactly right on dollar pairs. It's a generalization that is very similar on other pairs as well And the last lot we're going to take a look at is the micro lot The micro lot means you're controlling 1000 Units of a certain currency and that means that you are Losing or gaining 10 cents per PIP So every PIP that the market moves is going to be 10 cents up or down in your account if you're trading a micro lot And The last one that we're going to take a look at that we're not going to dive deep into it all is called a nano lot A nano lot means that you're controlling 100 units of currency and every Movement of a PIP is worth a penny the value per PIP is a penny which is something that we're not even going to worry about so In the case of the other lots, let's now break into let's dot let's get away from this Little section here and what we're going to do is break into Looking at the difference in prices between currency pairs and figuring out how much we gained or lost based on that difference in price So for instance if you bought the euro dollar EUR at 1.0802 And it went to 1.0902 Non-02 if you were trading a standard lot and this happened how much would you gain on that position? How much money is that actually worth and that's what we're going to determine and talk about up next so let's go ahead and do that All right, so let's move into this on the euro dollar trade here if we have the euro dollar at 1.0802 We trade one standard lot a hundred thousand units of this currency and we do so at 1.0800 O2 and this market moves to 1.09 O2 Going up we bought we wanted the market to go up and we take profit at 1.0902 How much money did we make if you can calculate how much money we made based on this trade? Remember a standard lot is 100,000 units of currency and with that 100,000 units of currency On any pair's ending in USD we're making and losing exactly 10 dollars the value of a pip is exactly 10 Dollars so let me share with you the equation you need to figure this out what you need first is the amount of pips So we're going to look at the amount of pips which is 100 We went up 100 pips in this particular case, right? So we have 100 pips Times the amount or the value per pip in this situation Based on your lot size So if we use the standard lot of 100,000 units and we know that a standard lot on the euro dollar is equal to 10 Dollars per pip then we would have our amount of pips Times 10 dollars per pip because we're using a standard lot And that we have to multiply by the amount of standard lots in this case we just traded one standard lot So with this being the case How much money did we make on this 100 pip move on the euro dollar? Well, the money would translate to 100 times 10 because we're using a standard lot and with a standard lot We are making and losing 10 dollars per pip the value per pip is 10 dollars We only traded one standard lot. So therefore 100 times 10 is $1,000 is what you made or what we would have made on this 100 pip move out of the euro dollar Now let's change things up for a second and say we wanted to trade three standard lots In this case what would change what number in the equation? Well, we need to change if this was the case and we were trading three standard lots instead of one Well, if that was the case we would have to change the third number in this equation We still have a 100 pip move right pips is right here We still are trading standard lots. So standard lot is right here. Now. We need number of lots So what's the number of lots when we're trading three? So that would mean that this 100 pip move if you were trading three standard lots would equal a $3,000 game Now let's look at this in a different way that always helped me to better understand what's actually going on whenever i place trades So let's move back to placing a buy order with one standard lot on the euro dollar If you're doing this essentially You are telling your broker that you are going to want 100,000 euros Not one million euros. What am I doing? 100,000 euros. So if you're gonna purchase 100,000 euros Your brokerage is going to charge you the exchange rate that the market currently has which is 1.0802 100,000 times 1.0802 Would be they will charge you 108 1,002 So that's what you're being charged to get 100,000 euros your broker gives you that 100,000 euros They get 108,002 dollars from you from your account Then you are holding that 100,000 euros waiting on the market to either rise or fall waiting on the euro dollar day the rise or fall in this case you bought the euros And the market went up from 108,02 to 102 meaning that you still have the same 100,000 euros that you are holding but now instead of them having a value of 108,000 and two dollars They now have a value because of the difference in the exchange rate the exchange rate has went up They now have a value of 109,000 and two dollars and that's where you're getting that $1,000 if you're trading a standard lot So that's the way a pip works if you're trading a standard lot Let's go into the way a pip works if you're trading a mini and a micro lot just to make sure you have a solid grasp on this We'll keep the math easy with a 100 pip move except now instead of trading one standard lot We're going to assume that you we're gonna do a little bit of a difficult thing here a little more difficult as we go Let's assume you want to trade to mini lots So you're trading too many lots and do you remember what a mini is a mini is you holding 10,000 units of currency. So if you're trading too many you're holding 20,000 units of currency A mini is worth $1 per pip meaning the value of a pip if you're trading a mini lot is $1 So in this case the market goes up by 100 pips So our equation would still be pips would be 100 Times the value per mini lot per pip when you're trading a mini lot Which is $1 times the amount of mini lots you're trading which is two meaning That you're your profit on this trade if you were trading a mini lot would be 100 times one which is 100 Times two which is the amount of mini lots you're trading so you would have a profit of $200 on this particular trade Now let's go through the other way of looking at it on a mini lot as well. What you are saying is broker. I want 20,000 euros And they are going to Math is gonna get a little more difficult here. Hold on. They're going to charge you bring a calculator over 1 1.0802 times 20,000 When they do that they're going to be charging you $21,604 So when they're charging you $21,604 you're holding 20,000 units of euro So while you hold that 20,000 units of euro just as in our last example the euro goes up 100 pips So you still have that same 20,000 euros except now you have to multiply that 20,000 20,000 Units that you're holding times the new exchange rate of 1.0902 Which means when you give them that 20,000 units back they owe you 21,800 and $4 giving you That $200 profit. So that's the way profit and loss works in a mini lot no matter how many it is We have our equation right pips times the amount per pip the value per pip times the amount of lots You decide to trade one more example of this and then i'm going to show you how i personally calculate pips And how i use risk management in my own trading, but let's go through This last example first on a micro lot. So let's say you want to trade one micro lot And you're doing that while the you buy that one micro lot the markets at 1.0802 just as with the other examples We go up 100 pips What's our equation look like what we have to do our 100 pips times 10 cents Times the amount of micro lots. We're trading which in this case is one What is that equal? That means that you would have made 10 Dollars on this 100 pip move trading one micro lot. So as we do With every other lot size let's go ahead and look at it in a different way So you're telling your broker. I want 1000 units of the euro and they're telling you if you want 1000 units of the euro We're going to charge you 1000 and 80 Dollars And then you say okay i'm fine with that you exchange it you hold that 1000 euros until the price rises by 100 pips And when it does you're saying 1000 euros is now worth 1000 And 90 dollars because of that rise in price. So that's exactly how The value of a pip works when using a certain lot size now for my own personal trading As I said at the beginning of the video I actually trade based on a certain percentage of my account values the Lot size is always a random number and that's an extremely simple thing to do If you have the right platform so i'm going to show you my platform and show you how i actually Determine the value per pip myself. This was for anyone using empty for or a brokerage That doesn't allow you to have random lot sizes. So I hope that was helpful Let's break into the way I actually prepare have risk management the way that I Calculate value per pip on my own personal trading right now. Okay, so now let's talk about how I personally calculate the value per pip And first let's talk about why you even need all of this information. Why do you need to understand how much Every pip is worth depending on the lot size that you're trading Well, the reason is because of risk management you want to understand That so that you can know how much of your account you're risking per trade Whatever your stoploss is and and also how much you can make per trade But the more important part of this equation is how much you can lose So with that being the case the reason we want to understand the value of the pip Is because we want to understand how much we're risking on each trade With that being the case the way I use risk management and calculate the value per pip Is a lot different than what I just showed you because my brokerage as we've discussed in the beginning and my platform Allow me to trade completely random unit sizes. So for me It's a lot easier than having to do any of that math I learned that at the beginning and I know that's something a lot of you may have to use But for those of you who have the same brokerage as me or for those of you who have a brokerage That allows you to use random units to place orders This is what I personally do. I want to share this with you as well So all I do if I want to place a trade let's say I wanted to buy the euro the new zeland dollar right now Which is the currency pair we're on I would go to create a new order I would have a market order in and I would set my stop loss and let's do this first Let's go ahead and do say I want to buy the new zeland dollar right now I want to have a stop loss below This red candle So that's my stop loss and I have a target at a two-to-one risk reward So if this is the case I now have my trade set up So what I'll do is go to trade create new order It's going to be a buy order on the new zeland dollar and I know where my stop loss is. It's at 100 pips So 100 pips is my stop loss. I know my target's at 200 pips around a two-to-one risk reward With this being the case my units For me are completely irrelevant and this is the reason i'm trading based on a certain risk Of my account with every position that I take out the certain risk for me is between 1 and 2 percent So for me the easy way that I do this is I go here to trading view I place my order and I put in What amount of risk I want to use as you can see right here on the order form It says percent risk when I put in 2 percent risk You can see that it shows me the size and units that i'm actually purchasing and this number is completely Again, some brokerages may only allow you to place trades based on standard lots In that case you would need to trade two standard lots and it would be completely different for you But for the way I trade for my brokerage and my platform I'm allowed to trade based on a certain percentage of my account value Which is what I like to do for every trade I place therefore the lesson we just went over It's kind of irrelevant for me at this point in my trading considering the technology that I use here over on the trading view platform In order to determine the amount of risk i'm going to use in my Personal trading account with every trade that I place so I wanted to give you both of those So that you now at least understand how to Calculate the value of a pip based on your order size And also you know now that you can go over to trading view and you can see the amount of units You need to purchase based on the percentage of risk of your account We're going to go over a lot more of that later on in the course in terms of how to calculate risk Perposition and things like that's going to be later on right now I just want you to understand how to calculate the value of a pip and I want to show you how I personally Calculate the value of a pip later on and in the next lesson. We are going over What leverage really means so in that video in the next video we're going to talk a lot about leverage I really hope you enjoyed this video and I hope that you got value out of it Hopefully now you understand exactly how to calculate the value of a pip and I'll talk to you in the next video.
