So as you can see on the screen in front of you This is that same consolidation pattern we were looking at and we actually got that breakout to the upside that we were talking about And as I was saying in that clip my reason for wanting to be involved in this trade long is because we had just come off This daily level of structure that I had pointed out in a previous structure based trading video Since we pushed off that level so strongly I decided that my new bias in this market was long Since I have a long bias and then this market did break out of this consolidation pattern That gave me enough reason to go ahead and enter the trade with a stop loss below the most previous swing low and Initial targets were at a one-to-one risk reward after moving the stop loss to break even we have now pushed up over 320 pips on the second part of this position and this trade was taken using nothing more than simple patterns Along with the structure levels that I point out here in the structure based trading series So guys if you want to make sure that you're alerted first whenever these videos come out Then what you can do is actually head over to the trading channel Dot net and I'll have a link in description along with a link in the top right hand corner of your screen in the cards Head up over here and go ahead and sign up for our email list doing this will not only ensure that you receive alerts Whenever I come out with free educational content here on YouTube, but you'll also receive one of my own Potential trade setups each week along with other free educational material on Forex So if you're interested in receiving more free stuff from us here at the trading channel Then make sure to click that link in the description and go sign up for that email list this so far has been a very nice trade But we have to look at the future guys We have to go ahead and be prepared for the next move here on the pound dollar So let's go ahead and zoom back out to a daily chart and start our structure based analysis there All right guys, so here we are out on the daily chart and as you can see we had this level here That was a daily level that we expected to become resistance right and if you've watched some of my previous Structure based trading videos, you'll know that I don't just take positions at these levels of structure And in the same sense, I don't just remove a position I was already long the pound dollar and this market gave me no reason whatsoever to believe that it would turn around at This level of structure right here. We blew right past that level So I had no reason to exit the position But the question we have to ask ourselves and the question I'm going to ask is what are we looking for next our next red level Our next red line here indicates a level of daily structure that was tested multiple times as resistance and support This will be my next level for potential profit-taking along with the potential Short entry if we get the right kind of entry reason The market's pushing up pretty hard now So it's likely that we could see this within the rest of this week or early on into next week So what I'll be looking for is the market to push into this level and give me some type of entry reason some type of Retest of structure on a lower time frame or if I'm trying to be very aggressive This is a pretty good level that I may take a position on a certain candlestick pattern And now since we have pushed above our Previous level that was red what I'm gonna do is turn that line to blue because it's now going to turn into Our next level of support. So what's something else that could happen here? Let's go ahead and prepare for it now There's no way to actually predict exactly what's going to happen But if we prepare for every situation, it's going to give us a much better opportunity once the market does anything So what I'm doing now is not only preparing for this market to push up into our red level But I'm also going to prepare myself for a pullback. Let's prepare ourselves for if the market decides to pull back if it pulls back, what are we gonna be waiting for? Well, we've already pointed out our major level of structure that we're gonna be looking at as support now the market is above it And it's right here. So we'll be looking in this zone For some kind of entry reason That'll tell us the market's going to be supported from that zone and a push back up into our red level That's what we'll be looking for if this market pulls back now if this market doesn't pull back We are discussed that we'll be looking for the market to push into That red level and give us some type of entry reason to push back down close to our blue level close to our support level That is and I'll go ahead and delete these arrows so we can point out our next level of resistance as well So guys as a level of resistance what I want to see is a level that's been tested multiple times in the past And the only level I see that that is the case of is right in here The red line you see on your screen now is actually a level that has been tested multiple times out here on this daily chart and that will be the next level I'll be looking for for a shorting opportunity so if this market Continues higher pushes directly above that resistance level then the next time I'll be looking for a shorting Opportunity here on the pound dollar based on the structure based analysis. I'm teaching here in this video is when the market gets to The 1.3378 level now this is going to be a zone not necessarily an exact point in the market So we'll be looking somewhere in that area so guys for the pound dollar We have resistance where we just pointed out we also have resistance at 1.3057 We have our support levels looking like 1.2886 and 1.2629 These are all zones not necessarily specific levels so if the market gets within those zones and gives the correct kind of entry reason That's where I'll be looking yet on the pound dollar for my next potential trading opportunities So let's go ahead and move on to our next pair guys next we're gonna be looking at the Aussie dollar Here we are on the Aussie dollar and I'll go ahead and make this full screen as you can see we pushed up to our next resistance level We got a little pullback from that before the market decided to break through that resistance so the next thing I'll be looking for here on this market Let's go ahead and turn this line to blue because this line since being broken and closed above is now going to represent a Level in the market that could be support So now what we're looking for is either this market to push up into our next level of resistance at 0.7712 That area and give us some kind of entry reason to push us down to our next level of daily Support or this market could very well stop where it is now and push down into Our next support level here and if that happens then I'll be looking for some type of entry reason there to go long So our closest resistance and support level is going to be support at 0.7618 and Resistance at 0.7712 those two zones are our nearest support and resistance zones a little bit lower than that It's going to be 0.7502 That's our support if the market breaks through this previous support level and continues to fall That's the area we'll be looking at for the market to be supported and if we break above our closest resistance level here Then we'll be looking for the 0.7 809 area for our next level of resistance and guys the reason these levels are levels of resistance for me This one is because it's the highest level we can see looking left This one as you can see has been touched multiple times throughout This section of the chart along with multiple times here making it a very strong resistance level out here on this daily chart this level of support How light it in blue has been tested multiple times as resistance and support before and here we have the same thing And guys I do want to point out that we actually had a losing trade in the EAP right at this level yesterday So I actually had a comment on one of my previous videos asking me if I ever lost trades Well, this guys is proof I go down to a four-hour time frame You can see that this was a nice level and this market gave us an entry reason down on a lower time frame Right in this area we were able to get involved and we did manage to get into profit, but unfortunately Not quite enough to hit our profit targets and the market did push up to stop us out on that trade But we've already pointed out that we are preparing for the next move here on the Aussie dollar So let's move on to our last pair for today Which is going to be the dollar Swiss and let's jump back out to the daily chart here on this pair And as you can see this pair is moving down pretty heavily and has been for a while now We're actually going to be looking at this level here. I will go ahead and circle The many times this level has been tested in the past as support and this is going to be the level we look for This market to be you're supported from and guys this is going to be a good opportunity for me to help you who are newer to trading Understand the difference between trend and counter trend trades It makes it a lot easier when you're pointing out levels like this because what you can say what you can put in your rules for trend and counter trend is if the market is in between my Higher time frame structure levels like this market is now and pushing down Then that means the markets in a downtrend and this market is obviously in a downtrend so if you were trying to make a Trend continuation trade you would be wanting to go short here on the dollar Swiss It would not be a trend continuation trade based on this chart if you were to try to go long That would be a counter trend trade and that's kind of what we're looking for at these levels guys Now it would be a trend continuation trade if the market pulled back from here got up to our Daily resistance here that we have pointed out and then we took a trade going short. That would be a trend continuation trade or if we went down to a lower time frame where we're at right now and we waited on a pullback and Some kind of consolidation pattern to trade a breakout here on this pair That would be a trend continuation trade But once the market gets to this level if we wait for the market to push down to this blue level And then we take a long opportunity on this market that is going to be considered a counter trend trade And so if you're a trader who has decided to be one or the other if you've decided to either be Trend continuation or counter trend Then make sure you understand the difference because that will make it a lot easier for you to sustain a profitable strategy so on this market here on the dollar Swiss our resistance is actually going to be around 0.9668 and as I was just discussing if this market pushes up to that level I'll be looking for a reason to hop on this trend to the downside Meaning looking for an entry reason I will not be just opening a position blindly if the market touches that level and if the market pushes Down continues lower as it seems to be doing now. We're gonna be looking at the 0.9 5 3 level For a counter trend trading opportunity down on lower time frames if we bust through that level we have a long way to fall and Hint hint for you trend continuation traders. We have a long way to fall So in that area between our 0.9 5 3 and 0.9 5 2 Structure levels would be a good opportunity for some trend continuation to the downside But if we do bust through that level our next level is going to be down here at 0.9 to that area of Support is what we'll be looking for for our next counter trend trading opportunity And if we push above our most previous resistance level we will be looking for our next trend continuation Possibility at the 0.9 8 5 3 area. This area is an area that I like a lot So if we get back up to this area I will consider taking a very aggressive entry because of this structure shelf that has been created in the past It's a very nice area for a trade and would make for a beautiful shorting opportunity so traders those are the Areas in the market that I'm paying attention to for future trading opportunities As I said earlier if you'd like to be alerted as soon as these videos come out to make sure you sign up for that email list Link to the website is listed in the description below the video If you happen to be one of the many traders who is struggling to find a way to be profitable because of lack of a profitable Strategy or lack of discipline in your trading and you would like a mentor and a program that is dedicated to helping you Become profitable and take control of your trading Then what I'll do is leave a link in the description below this video and a link in the top right in the corner of your screen To the eaP training program that we offer here at the trading channel We are running a 25% discount on that program that will end at the end of this month So July 1st that discount will be gone and we'll also be making some changes to the pricing model So if you'd like to get involved in that then go ahead and do so otherwise Be sure to stay tuned here on my YouTube channel because I will be producing valuable free educational content just like this on a daily basis So make sure you're subscribed here at the trading channel.
