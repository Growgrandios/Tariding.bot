So a quick recap, we are going to wait for this first initial swing low to occur. We're going to wait for a pullback that then begins to fail by pushing back lower. We're going to create a termination zone between the body and the low of that initial low of the double bottom. Then we're going to wait and see if price eventually comes down and at least touches this area, can close inside of it, can wait past it, cannot close below it. As long as that occurs, we have a valid double bottom already, but we're not entering the trade just because of that valid double bottom criteria. Our entry criteria, or at least for me, the way I've traded this and seemed to be most profitable is having that entry criteria be when price crosses above the neckline of our double bottom. That will be the entry and for stops and targets. Super simple stops just below the lowest point of the double bottom targets at this point at a 1.4 to 1 reward-to-risk ratio.
