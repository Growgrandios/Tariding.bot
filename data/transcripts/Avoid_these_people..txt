Stay away from these five types of people. The last one is the most dangerous. One, stay away from those who haven't achieved anything in their own lives, but always blame others for their work. Two, stay away from fools and addicts who are always intoxicated. Three, stay away from unhappy and troubled people, because they won't find peace themselves and won't let you live in peace either. Four, stay away from your enemies, because they will do anything to bring you down. Five, stay away from those who talk behind your back. If you agree with this video, then comment, yes.
