Before we can win the battle against the markets, we must first win the battle against ourselves. Success in anything in life takes a massive amount of self-discipline. For a basketball player, this may be going outside and shooting 103 point shots every single day. For a student, it may be studying four hours a night before their final exams to make sure that they pass. And for us as traders, it means taking the deep dive into charts, into our computers, and into back testing and learning the appropriate information to make sure that we eventually become consistently profitable. 99% of people will not be willing to do what it takes to make the necessary sacrifices or to put in the work that is necessary for them to achieve what they want. My question to you is, are you willing to make those sacrifices? And how much work are you willing to put in to separate yourself from the 99%? Hey guys, welcome to the trading channel. My name is Stephen, you're Honest Trading Coach. And in today's video, we're going to discuss my two favorite indicators. Not only that, we're also going to discuss how to use indicators correctly in the Forex market. And at the end of the video, we're actually going to create a strategy around using the two indicators we're going to talk about today. So that sounds interesting to you.

And I'll see you guys on the other side. Welcome back traders. So before we begin, I'm actually going to go ahead and apologize. It's been a couple of weeks since I've been able to produce any content for you guys here on YouTube. And the reason for that is because we've been working really hard on the brand new EAP training program content. This program is going to have new strategies, new techniques, along with a step-by-step guide to creating a full trading plan around a strategy. So shameless plug if you're interested in learning more about the new EAP training program. The link is in the description to learn more labeled EAP training program. Otherwise, that's fine too. We're going to dive into today's video and start talking about indicators. Indicators are widely used in the financial markets for good reasons. They can help us make trading decisions when used correctly. The problem with indicators is that most new traders, for some reason, believe that there is some kind of magic indicator that's going to tell them exactly when to enter a trade and going to work 80, 90, or even 100% of the time. Now this is where using an indicator can go extremely bad. See indicators can be one of two things. They can either be your worst enemy or your best friend. So in today's video, we're going to talk about how to make these indicators your best friend. So let's dive into the charts and talk about some of my favorite indicators now. The first thing we're going to take a look at and the first indicator we're going to discuss is the RSI indicator. This is a very commonly used indicator and it actually is one of my favorites. Now the thing that makes these indicators powerful and your best friend instead of your worst enemy is instead of using them as an extremely accurate way to enter the market, which no indicators are, what you want to do is use them as non-subjective rules in creating a strategy. So what I mean by non-subjective is that if I asked 1000 traders, if this was resistance, right here, I may get 10, 20, 30 different answers of yes, no, maybe, and this is why and why not. But if I asked 1000 traders, if our black line here on the RSI was above our red line, all 1000 of those traders should say yes. So that makes it non-subjective, meaning that there's no way to get it wrong. So using an indicator like the RSI indicator to create a non-subjective rules based strategy is how you can make an indicator into your best friend instead of worst enemy. So in the case of RSI, we all know that when an RSI is overbought or oversold, you've probably heard that that means the market is exhausted. If it's overbought, it's time to look for selling opportunities. And if it's oversold, it's time to look for buying opportunities. Now that alone will not make a profitable strategy. Of course, all strategies that are rules based need multiple rules, multiple conditions mixed with entry reasons in order to actually be profitable. So for the RSI indicator, what we would want to look for is an overbought condition followed by other conditions. What other conditions could we use? Well, one condition we could use is pointed out by our red line here. This is a daily level of structure. And it's a daily level of major structure that's been tested multiple times. So now we're starting to combine things. We're combining the fact that we have a condition of overbought on our RSI with the condition of being at a daily level of structure that could possibly act as resistance. Now, what else can we add to this? Well, we can add that we need a double top after creating overbought RSI at this level. What would that be? Well, right here we have a nice double top after the RSI going overbought and at the condition that we're actually right up against a previous daily level of major structure. All of those conditions combining now all we have to do is look for an entry reason. And that's something we're not going to discuss in this video, but you could create an entry reason that's just based on the double top. As soon as we get that double top, enter the market. You could create plenty of different entry reasons, but the main point is that we're using the indicator not as an entry reason. We're not using the indicator to give us a magic system that's going to create a 100% accurate strategy, but we're using it as a non-subjective rule that can help us to create a rules-based strategy. Rules-based strategy, literally an example of that could be we're waiting for the market to get to a daily level of structure. Is the market overbought? Yes. Do we get a double top? Yes. Is there a side of virgins on the double top? Yes. We can create a strategy around this that is completely non-subjective and the power of that is never being confused. Again, we've all had situations where we're sitting here looking at the market and we have no idea what to do. I'm sure you've been there before. I have as well the beginning of my trading career. This completely takes that away. Being able to create a rules-based trading plan takes away any confusing aspects of your trading because now you have a set of rules. Now you know that the only time I'm looking for a short trade is when the market's overbought and at a daily level of structure and we get a double top and we have our side of virgins. Now I can start looking for an entry reason to actually place my trade maybe on a lower time frame or maybe on this time frame, but the point is using the indicator as a non-subjective rule for a rules-based strategy and the RSI indicator is definitely one of my favorite indicators to do this with. Now we're actually in the process of creating an RSI-based strategy for the new EAP training program which for you members will be released here very shortly. The other indicator that is one of my favorites is the ATR or average true range indicator. You can see this at the top of my page. If you look in the top left over here, you can see that we actually have a number. This number is what the ATR of the current candle is or the ATR of the candle that you're hovering over at that moment. So for the ATR indicator, the reason this is such a powerful indicator in my trading is because it gives me a non-subjective rule for determining volatility in the market. And I know that may be a lot of big words that you may not be used to if you're a beginner, but what I'm saying essentially is that this ATR indicator is going to give me an average of the last few candles. The last few candles may have moved a lot. They may have moved very little, but that becomes irrelevant because now I have a non-subjective way to determine how much those candles have moved. And the reason that's important is because when we're placing a stop loss and we're placing targets for trades, we want to be congruent with the volatility of the market. If the market's moving in very small candles, barely moving, maybe consolidating, we're going to have a much smaller range that we can look at for targets and a much smaller range we have to use for stop loss. Whereas if the market's moving in a very volatile way, then that be in the case. We may want to increase the size of our stop loss to make sure we don't get stopped out, or we may increase the size of our targets so that we can get a better risk reward profile out of a trade. And the way we use to determine all of that is a non-subjective indicator called the average true range. This indicator can be found on pretty much every trading platform. I personally use trading view in order to do all of my analysis. And in order to find it, all you have to do is go to indicators and type in average true range. It comes with a setting of 14, I believe. And that's what I keep it at. I keep it at the stock setting for the ATR indicator. And it's something that I use on a daily basis in order to help me determine stop and target placement. Now, as for the RSI indicator, what I like to use for this indicator, if I double click it, you'll see my settings is a 10 period RSI. And I keep the overball and oversold lines exactly where they are. Overballed is 70, oversold is 30. So with those indicators, something we could do, we could actually create a whole trade right here on the Aussie dollar based on what we've just talked about. And I know that this has been a pretty quick video, but implementing the things that you've learned here in this video can be extremely beneficial, although it's been pretty fast. Let's take a look here on the chart on the Aussie dollar. We're going to use the ATR indicator and the RSI indicator. And this is the strategy we just talked about. What we could say is I do not place a trade unless the RSI goes overballed while we are at a previous daily level of structure. I do not place a trade unless we have RSI divergence on a double top. I enter next bar market on the double top. Let's consider that as a trading plan. Well, the way we would set a trade up using all that information is right here was that double top entry. I'll zoom the chart in a little bit more so you guys can see that. Right there, the close of our green candle would be our double top entry. Now, the way we use ATR would be looking at the ATR of that candle. If you look at the top left where we were just at right here, you'll see that that says 22. And it may be, and that may be hard to see, but just take my word for it. That says 22. And that being 22 means that we can come here to our stop loss, bring it down to that previous swing low. Whoa, that's a lot of gray. Bring it here to our previous swing low. Excuse me, swing high right here. And we can add 22 pips to that. So we have 10 pips. That would be a 32 pips stop loss. And for targets, you could go back at previous structure. And as you can see, that would have ended up being a successful trade based around the entire strategy we just created using the things we've discussed in this video. We've used the ATR indicator and the RSI indicator to create an entirely rules based strategy that can be tested, verified, and repeated throughout time here in the forex market. And guys, again, having this rules based strategy can be extremely simple, yet extremely effective. And when it comes to creating discipline for your trading plan and even having a trading plan, which is something that 90% of traders don't have, but you are a part of the trading channel. And you are here with us, which means that you now have the knowledge and the education it takes to understand and know what you need to do in order to create a rules based trading plan.
