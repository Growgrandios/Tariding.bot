No matter what strategy you learn, your trading will never be successful or profitable consistently if you don't master and use these three things. Number one is discipline. If you cannot stay disciplined to a consistently profitable trading strategy, then you're going to be switching strategies, moving your stop up and down, moving your target up and down. You're going to make a ton of trading mistakes and that's going to cause you to slowly lose money in your account. Number two is your risk management. How much can you control the greed you have to try to get rich as fast as possible? The more we risk on a trade, the more we can make, but obviously the more we risk on a trade, the more we stand to lose on that trade as well. And number three, have proper expectations around trading. Be prepared to spend a long time learning how to trade. It's difficult. Be prepared to use good risk management where you're not going to get rich super fast, but you can acquire wealth over time. If that's not something you're prepared for, trading may not be for you. You may be better off trying to start a different business.
