Hey traders, today is going to be a complete promotional video. So what I mean by that is if you are not interested in the EAP subscription service that I offer through my website, the TradingChannel.net, or if you don't think you'll ever be interested in paying for that program, then this is probably not the best video for you. And what I would suggest is to go ahead and skip this video and move on to another video from my channel. But if you're on the fence about the EAP and you were thinking about getting into it, or if this is your first time hearing about it and you're interested in it, then make sure to keep it locked right here because when we get back, I'm going to explain a lot more about the EAP, show you exactly how to sign up, and tell you about the extended discount offer that I'm offering on the EAP. And I also talked to you a little bit about the trade I took, as you can see here on the chart in front of you on the dollar Swiss, using the analysis that I teach in the email analysis program. So if you're interested in learning my system, then keep this video rolling through the intro and disclaimer. Click that like button for me. Make sure to subscribe if you're new. And I'll be right back to talk to you a little more about the EAP. Hey traders. So today I just wanted to show you an awesome trade that I sent out analysis for yesterday on the dollar Swiss. This analysis was on a dollar Swiss flag pattern that I recognized and sent out to traders when the market was right here, right at the close of this little green candle. Now if you want to know exactly why I placed this trade in the exact analysis I did before placing it and get your hands on the set of rules that I use every single time that I place a trade. In essence, learn my entire trading system. Then make sure you sign up for the EAP, the email analysis program before Sunday. This offer was supposed to expire today, but I realized that most of us work throughout the week so we don't really have a chance to watch videos, read through our email and purchase things until the weekend. So I've decided to extend the offer instead of the offer ending today. The offer will end Sunday night at midnight. The offer that I'm talking about is if you sign up for my EAP, my email analysis program before Sunday, then you'll receive two training videos, which is called my condensed training course. These two videos are going to show you exactly how I trade the forex market. They will outline my entire system and show you all of the rules that I use when trading forex so that you can spot trades like this on your own. Not to mention the fact that you are also going to be receiving email analysis from yours truly showing you set ups that I'm looking at and a detailed description of why I plan to place that trade which will be in confluence with the training course that you take. In a sense, I'm not only showing you exactly how I trade, I'm also going to be walking you through trade setups throughout the week, every week for the lifetime of your membership. Now the regular price for the EAP is $39.99. But if you order before Sunday, not only do you get those two free training videos, which I'll go ahead and show you now. So here we are on the members page. What I'm talking about when I say you're getting the training course for free, these are my EAP training course videos, in other words, the condensed course that I plan to sell after this Sunday. The price for that course will be at least $159. Depending on the amount of material I keep putting into the course, I also plan to do a full video on how to back test the strategy and possibly a risk management section of the video. So if I decide to do those two videos, then the price will probably go up. And while you're in the course and the EAP, you can ask my other subscribers. I do continuously add material throughout this process with extra training videos and also with our weekly recap videos as you see down here. So this is what you'll get access to as long as you pay before Sunday at midnight. Sunday at midnight, this is coming off our members page, the training course videos. I'll have a brief description of what I do in the EAP here instead of these full training course videos. And you will still have access to the weekly recap videos. But as for these two very detailed training videos, you will not have access to them. So let's head back to the charts now that we've discussed that a little. So I wanted to get this out to you guys and give you an opportunity to enter the program before Sunday just to show you what you'll be getting if you decide to subscribe to the EAP. And what I'll do now is go ahead and take you over to the actual email that I sent out to the traders that are subscribed to the EAP. As you can see, I alerted the traders of a dollar Swiss flag pattern. And if you look here on the chart, you can see that that alert came out as soon as the market came to our top trend line right before breaking out. And I told these traders exactly what I was looking at, that the market was in a condition where I thought that we could see a breakout that would take this market a lot higher than it is now. And I explained how I plan to enter the trade. Now that information is below this section, but I can't let you see that because that is part of the EAP and it would not be fair to the paying subscribers. But if you're interested in getting analysis just like this, three to five times a week, sometimes less, sometimes more depending on market conditions, then make sure you head over to the trading channel.net and I'll go there with you now. Scroll down here until you see EAP subscription service. You can read a little about it here and then click to learn a little more. And this is a detailed description of what is offered through the EAP. And once you have read through all of this and if you like it and decide to subscribe, then you can just click here and pay for the EAP that will take you to a PayPal payment page where you can enter your name, email and submit either a monthly price of $29.99 or you can pay for the yearly subscription at a 15% discount for $300. Now both of these prices will be going up as of Sunday night at midnight. So this essentially is one of your last chances to take advantage of this situation and to take advantage of the discount. I'm not trying to pressure you into getting it. It's completely up to you whether or not you pay for it. I'm just trying to show you some of the things you'll be getting if you do decide you would like to invest in yourself and subscribe to the EAP to learn the strategy of a profitable trader. Now not only will you be getting the emails and the training course, you'll also have first priority email meaning anytime my EAP subscribers email me with any questions about the program, any questions about the market, I always try to respond same day. So this is not like other programs that I've heard of from other members who have told me that they've entered programs where the teacher was nowhere to be found after going through the course, they still were clueless about trading and even if they were paying a monthly subscription, they had a very hard time getting in touch with their mentor. If you subscribe to the EAP, I will have no problem at all answering any questions that you have in a timely manner. So if all that sounds interesting guys then go ahead and head over to the trading channel and read a little about the EAP subscription and if you decide to sign up then that's great. I would love to have you aboard and have you be a part of the community here at the trading channel and if not then that's okay too. I still wish you the best of luck on your trading journey and I hope that you'll stick around for more free material here on YouTube and take advantage of all educational material online. So with all that said, I wish you guys the best of luck. I hope you all have a great weekend and I hope to hear from you soon. See you later.
