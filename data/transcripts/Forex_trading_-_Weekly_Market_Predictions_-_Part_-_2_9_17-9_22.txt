So do those things while the intro disclaimer roll guys and I will be right back to discuss a little more about this week's predictions on the pound dollar the dollar yen and the dollar swiss. Welcome back guys so we're gonna go ahead and get today's video started on the pound dollar for our chart and we actually had a losing trade here on the pound dollar for our chart last week we were taking a short trade right out of this area and some of you may remember we actually had this as an idea on trading view and as you can see the market came up double-top we had nice RSI divergence this was at a previous daily level of structure meeting all the criteria for my own personal trading plan but unfortunately the market did not cooperate with that analysis and that's okay guys that's something that's important to remember we're not going to win every trade and that's not the point of trading the point is to give ourselves an advantage over the market so after that losing trade our analysis did actually play off the next day in last week's video we talked about this as a possible scenario we talked about it being possible that the market breaks above this level of daily resistance and then pulls back into that levels you see the important part is not to win every trade and it's not to know exactly what the market's going to do the important thing is to stay prepared for whatever the market does because in reality us as traders have no idea what the market will do but we can prepare for every situation although I was short here on the pound dollar I was prepared to take a long position if the market broken closed above this daily level of structure because that technically tells me that we're in an uptrend we're continuing this uptrend and although we are at a daily level structure here that we were discussing last week this is a counter-trend trade look at this market guys we've been going up and as we all know counter-trend trades are less likely to be winning trades then trend continuation trades so once the market broke and closed above that level we started looking for trend continuation and got some trend continuation out of this market once we pulled back into that daily level of structure so that's the importance of being prepared so now I'm going to quickly play you guys a clip from last week's video where we were pointing all of this out and then I'll come right back here to the pound dollar and we'll talk about what we could see next out of this specific pair so let's go ahead and head to that clip now there's also a possibility that the market does not respect our analysis whatsoever and that we see this market head higher as a trader it's important to remember that we never really know exactly what's going to happen in the market we just use our predictive analysis to give us an edge or an advantage over the market so we could possibly see this market head higher and if that's the case then we'll be looking for long opportunities up into the 1.3430 zone so if the market heads up and breaks above this previous level of resistance then that's what we're looking for this level here that we're at currently the 1.321 non-zone will turn into support and that's what we're looking for next long opportunities on the pound dollar and that's for this pound dollar trade all right guys so here we are back on the pound dollar we're on the daily chart now and as you can see that predictive analysis paid off quite nicely we have our level of resistance here that's the level we were talking about trying to get a close above before we saw a pull back into that red line that was now going to become support we got that pull back and a rip by the pound straight up over 200 pips to that next structure level and currently sitting around 300 pips above the structure level that we talked about as support so that's analysis that paid off pretty well last week let's go ahead and take a look at what we can expect next out of this market now of course we have to turn these lines to blue because that's how we indicate support here the trading channel so these two lines are now support and we only have one resistance line above price action which I do not like so we're gonna go ahead and zoom out the chart and point out our next level of resistance here on the pound dollar and I'm gonna let you guys go ahead and see if you can spot that next level of resistance that I'm going to point out remember we're looking for a level of structure that's been tested multiple times by this pair and respected and that level is gonna come right in here guys as you can see the market is used this level as support multiple times so if the market gets back up to that level then we can expect to see some kind of reaction so for all intensive purposes as of right now on the pound dollar looks as though we have ripped above this previous structure level at 1.3430 and the market seems to be pulling back towards that level so in that area is where we can start to look for some long opportunities and we have a long ways to go to the upside before our next level of major resistance which is around the 1.3853 area so that's our initial expectations here for the pound based on the trend based on the structure that we can currently see and as for our next level of resistance above that we're gonna be taking a look at the 1.40 nano level now if the market disagrees with this analysis again remember preparation is key not necessarily being correct all the time so so using that preparation we could say that if the market does not respect our analysis and instead closes below our 1.3430 level we could possibly see that level turn into resistance and we would be looking at our next level of support down here at 1.3208 that'll be the next level we look for long opportunities on this pair and if we break below that one more time we're gonna be looking at the 1.3054 zone for long opportunities here on the pound so those are the key levels of structure that we're paying attention to on the pound dollar now we'll go ahead and move on and we're gonna quickly go over the dollar yen and the dollar Swiss and the key levels of structure that we're paying attention to on these two pairs as for the dollar yen we're looking for resistance around 1.12.02 that is a level that we'll be looking for shorting opportunities from if the market makes it to that zone so once we get up here you're looking for some kind of shorting opportunity down to our first level of support which is at 1.10.71 that's where we can look for long opportunities or targets if we get up to 1.12 area and start to look for shorting opportunities if we get a shorting opportunity then the 1.10.71 area is where we can look for second targets on that trade now if we break below 1.10.71 our next level of support is looking like 1.08.97 it's another area we can look for long opportunities here on the dollar yen now above the 1.12 area of resistance we can start to look for some type of long trades if this market continues up and we will look for long trades up into the 1.14.18 area that's our next place to look for counter trends shorting opportunities here on the dollar yen so as for the immediate future we're waiting to see if this dollar yen pair can give us some type of entry reason up here a little closer to the 1.12 area so that's what we're looking at here on the dollar yen next up we're gonna take a look at the dollar Swiss and this pair is currently hovering around a resistance area but as you can see if I draw on a box it does not have very much room down to this next level of support so I'm not really paying attention to that area for any kind of shorting opportunities what I'd really like to see is this market break above that area and then pull back into this zone and turn into support before taking a long opportunity up to our next level of resistance at 0.9763 here on the dollar Swiss and above that our next level of resistance that we're gonna be looking at is going to be right in here as you can sell this market came to this level and used it as support multiple times in the past making it an important level of structure so if we break above 0.9763 we can look for the next level of resistance to be around 0.9869 here on the dollar Swiss now as for support we see this market drop we could be looking for some type of long opportunities around the 0.9558 level and below that we'll be looking right in here let me move this line up actually at our support level around 0.9443 that's actually going to be the next level of support where we look for long opportunities here on the dollar Swiss as you can see this again a level has been tested at support multiple times meaning that it could also act as support once more if the market gets down to this level and that's what we're going to be looking for guys out of the dollar Swiss all right guys that's going to do it for
