Whenever price is moving up and we have a push up, we have sellers that come into the market right here. That's the reason we get a pullback. The buyers are losing steam, sellers are coming in, trying to push price lower. So when buyers take back control, the sellers don't expect that. When they take back control and push higher than the previous highs, that means that buyers are actually in control because where buyers gave out last time is no longer where they're giving out now. They're pushing prices higher. And no matter how many sellers come into the market, they can't stop it. Whenever we get a pullback into this area, if you were selling short, let's say those people didn't have a stop loss in place at all, they can get out near break even, or even at break even if they were able to go short at this top. So we're catching those orders of people that were scared that went short because prices were going higher and now they're like, I'm getting out of my position. When you get out of a sell position, you have to buy. And we're also getting more buyers stepping into the market. So all that equals buying pressure that more often than not pushes prices into new highs.
