When I first started trading, I deposited money into a trading account and just assumed that I would be able to be profitable after doing so. Let me give you an analogy. If you wanted to be a doctor, would you walk into a hospital and start trying to reattach someone's ligament? You probably wouldn't, right? And I know that seems like a far-fetched example, but essentially that's what we're doing if we just deposit money into an account and try to start trading without ever learning out of trade. And you may be thinking, oh, but Steven, I've got a guy that sends me signals on text message. Well, let's use that same analogy. You walk into a hospital, you start attaching someone's ligament that they had torn, and then all of a sudden they go, hey, I think you're doing that wrong. And you say it's fine. I'm getting text messages from a doctor who knows how to do it. I think I'll be okay. It makes zero sense for any trader to start trading with live money until they have learned out of trade. That's why I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not going to be a doctor.
