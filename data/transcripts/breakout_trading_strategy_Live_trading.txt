Hey traders and welcome back. So what we're gonna do now is take a look at a purely structure based strategy that I like to use and this is gonna be a consolidation breakout strategy and I'm gonna share with you some very simple rules that you can use to start the process of building a strategy around consolidation breakouts. So as you can see here on the dollar Canada we are currently involved in a trade and the reason we're involved in this trade is because we have had a period of consolidation here that lasted about two weeks on the dollar Canada. We can all see this big period of consolidation where the market found resistance multiple times at our top blue line and support multiple times at our bottom blue line and after we got a breakout or a new high out of that period of consolidation as we did right here we were just waiting to see if this market was going to pull back into the previous levels of resistance here and here. The last step of the strategy is actually to create an entry reason and we actually have our own entry reason that I use and that I teach in the training program I run called the email analysis program but with this type of analysis you can apply your own entry reason because the main takeaway from this video needs to be how you can create these rules in order to make your consolidation breakout strategy as non-subjective as possible. So after we have these non-subjective rules for saying that the market is in a period of consolidation with the two resistance levels and two support levels being created now the only thing missing is that non-subjective entry reason so once you create your own non-subjective entry reason that you can use back at this previous level that gives you an opportunity to have a strategy that you can test throughout historical data throughout the market that you can repeat over and over. So if you have an entry reason here at this previous area let's say it's a double bottom on a lower time frame like a double bottom on an hourly chart and we're looking at this on a four-hour chart. So if your entry reason is a double bottom on a lower time frame then you can take those rules you can write them down you can add to them or take away from them in order to make your strategy more accurate or give yourself a better risk reward when it comes to stopping target placement. This is just giving you an idea of how you can actually create your own non-subjective strategy for consolidation breakouts. So as you can see after the market did push up over our previous resistance level it did pull back and giving us an opportunity to actually enter the trade where you see my position tool. So right on our blue line here is where we entered the trade and the market is now pushed up to give us a little more than a 1.8 risk reward. Currently sitting at about 1.5 on the second part of our position we've already taken off the first part of that position at a one-to-one risk reward. So let's talk about the simple rules that you can use in order to create a strategy around periods of consolidation. Well the rules that I start with are that I need to see a period of consolidation in which structure resistance has been tested at least two times and structure support has been tested at least two times. After seeing that that classifies this as a period of consolidation and at that point I can wait for the breakout to the up or to the downside followed by a pullback into a trend line then an entry reason looking for that move lower or higher in this case. So that's a pretty simple first set of rules right we're just looking for a period of consolidation in the market that's been tested multiple times as support and resistance followed by a breakout of that level followed by a pullback into either resistance or if we break out to the downside a pullback into support and then followed by an entry reason. And so let's take a look at a few more examples of this happening here in the Dollar Canada chart and I have not done this yet guys so bear with me if it takes a few seconds to find a couple of these levels. Here I already see one we have a period in the market that was tested twice as resistance here and here and multiple times as support as well so that creates our period of consolidation. Unfortunately after the breakout here there was no pullback in order for us to get involved and go long and of course within this video I'm just showing you guys how to create a consolidation breakout strategy you could easily change the rules for entry from a pullback into this top resistance level to just a clear breakout in which case you would be entering on this breakout candle here or this one here. Alright so let's take a look at a few more areas where the market consolidated enough for us to call that period of consolidation. Here I see a level where the market hit support multiple times but there is no level of market hitting resistance multiple times. So if we continue here we have a nice level the market had support here multiple times and resistance here multiple times and this would have actually been a successful trade so we have resistance one resistance to support one support two we have this nice breakout followed by a pullback waiting for that entry reason and then waiting for the market to go higher. So let's see if we can find one more example of this before getting back to our trade. So here we have another good example we're looking at support multiple times there resistance multiple times here so if I point these levels out once more we have support support resistance resistance market breaks through that previous level of support pulls back if I zoom in this may get easier for you guys to see waiting for an entry reason and then that next push down. And I'm sure if we looked long enough guys that we could find areas in the market where this strategy failed and more times that it succeeded as well but throughout my testing and trading I've noticed that if I wait for these periods of consolidation based on my rules and a breakout of those periods of consolidation and I enter the market using my entry reason that I have a statistical advantage over the market and over time consistently win trades. So if we head back over here to our trade now as I said after this pullback you guys can use any entry reason you would like but if you're interested in learning more about the entry reasons that I use in my personal trading then you can learn more about those in the training program I run called the email to analysis program or the EAP and what I'm gonna do now is briefly show you guys what you get with that program. So with the email analysis program if we head over to the website you get total access to a members only page on this members only page you'll have access to a complete training course which has about five videos showing you all the strategies I use in my structure based trading. These strategies are all rules based and easy to understand and you'll also have email support so if you have any questions you can email me and my team then we will assist you in any way possible. On this page there is also a back testing training section which will show you how to back test each of those strategies that you learned in the first training videos and then you'll also have access to the weekly recap videos starting from the beginning of our program in 2016 to today's date showing you exactly how these strategies have performed in the market based on the email analysis that I send out. Now what is email analysis? Email analysis is something that also comes with this EAP program and email analysis is emails throughout the week that I send you of analysis that I'm doing on a pair before I decide to place a trade on that pair. So if I see a setup that is congruent with the rules that you learned here in the first training video then I email members of the EAP something that looks like this with a screenshot of that trade and this is actually our USD Canada trade that we're looking at today along with this screenshot. I have a brief description of my analysis and why I decided to take this trade based on the rules you learned in that first training video and also always put my entry stop and target so you can really see how I plan to take and manage this specific trade. So as you can see on this dollar Canada trade I sent out an email this morning explaining the traders that we were at a previous level of resistance after this consolidation breakout we have now come down into that previous level of resistance and put in a good entry reason and this was just before I placed the trade. So guys if you're interested in learning more about those interviews instead I use or if you're interested in receiving email analysis on trades that I plan to take then make sure to click the link in the description below this video labeled EAP to learn a little more about that program. Alright so now that we've talked a little bit about creating a strategy based around consolidation breakouts in the market and how we can set up some simple rules in order to make that strategy less subjective. Now what we're actually going to do is take a look at a few different target and stop loss placement ideas. So the reason I wanted to discuss this is because I know a lot of newer traders including myself when I first started we all managed to look for something that is set in stone something we can use for every single strategy that we have in our arsenal when it comes to taking profits and setting stop losses. When the fact of the matter is that some stop losses for instance something that's very common is placing a stop loss above below the previous swing high and swing lows right. Well the fact of the matter is that while this stop loss placement may work great for some strategies it may not work so well for others. So how do we counteract that? Well we have to look at a few different ways of taking profits and a few different ways of setting your stop loss for instance on this specific trait we'll just use this as an example and as you can see guys it's been a couple of days since I was shooting the last part of that video and we have actually came up hit first targets and backed down to be stopped out for break even on the second part of our position here on the dollar Canada but we took our position out about right here and the way I chose to place my stop loss was by going under my entry candle by a few pips so in doing so I created a good opportunity to give myself a decent risk to reward ratio which is something that I regard very highly in my trading so by setting my stop loss there I had an opportunity to gain a little over a two-to-one risk reward on this trait so this is one of the ways I choose to set a stop loss for this specific type of strategy now for trend continuation strategies when the market's doing something like this and you can get involved in a pullback then that I think is a very good time for you to consider a stop placement that's below the previous swing low like here because at that point you can still get yourself about a one-to-one risk reward if you're shooting for a previous level of resistance like here but in this case let's see what that type of stop loss would have meant for our trade so getting involved here if we were to place our stop loss below the previous swing low we'd be looking at something like a 140-pip stop loss so on these consolidation breakout trades majority of the time your breakout is going to come very far away from your previous swing low which means a very large stop loss and unfortunately if you're a trader who cares about risks to reward and you're trying to get at least a one-to-one as I do for my first targets then you're gonna have a very difficult time doing that and not necessarily difficult but it will take you much longer and the market does have to move more in order to hit your target so for that reason I've decided to use different stop placement for different strategies and there's a number of different ways that you can place a stop loss you can do so by an average true range indicator just look up ATR in your trading platform and you should have no problems finding that if you don't quite know what an ATR is there are a few videos that explain it very well here on YouTube as we discussed you can go with the swing low or the entry candle and you can go a set number of pips instead of using the ATR indicator such as 10 to 20 pips on an hourly time frame and 30 or above on a four-hour chart so at this point you have enough information to go out in the market and test a few different consolidation breakout strategies you can make up your own rules you can add rules to make your consolidation breakout strategy more accurate or better when it comes to risk to reward just as we've discussed here using stop loss and target placement ideas trading forex is a very difficult thing to do guys but if you put your mind to it if you get the right type of training and if you put in the work to actually test strategies that you create in order to give yourself the confidence to be disciplined to that strategy then you will have a much better chance of actually becoming a consistently independent profitable trader and again if you would like help along your journey to becoming consistently profitable then I've placed a link down below this video where you can learn a little more about the training programs that I offer otherwise make sure you're subscribed to this channel so you're alerted when I come out with more free educational content here on YouTube click that like button for me if you've got some entertainment or beneficial knowledge from this video I hope you guys have a great weekend I wish you the best of luck in the markets throughout all your future trades and I'll talk to you guys next time throw your stones like me it drifts away I would watch you stare I would watch you stare oh but there's no one there we can figure this out put your feet down the other night it was While you choice do mine until you bring my thing I'm the one wishing to know I'll end hope that now you keep them for yourself and know that I know that was a time when we never let go, never let go, we never let go We can figure this out, put your feet down We are the love we want We follow you choices today We follow you choices today We follow you, I'm sad until you break my mind
