Alright traders so let's go ahead and get today's analysis started only euro dollar daily chart. Over the past couple of weeks we've had a few really good trades off of this pair and off the levels we pointed out we had a short trade from the 1.2057 level we also had a long trade within the last couple of weeks from this previous resistance level that turned into support for this pair right in here. So let's try to continue that process we're going to go ahead and point out the key levels first and as you can see I already have them marked with my red and blue lines. The blue lines are going to be the major levels of support that I'm paying attention to on this pair and the red lines are going to be the major levels of resistance. So for support we do have this 1.1871 level where the market's hovering right now and really will have to wait to the end of this day in order to see whether or not this support level holds. Now unless this market before the end of the day pushes back up and closes above this level then I have a short bias here on the euro dollar and I'll take this chart down to a smaller time frame we'll discuss a little more about that in just a second but as for my other levels of support if this market does fall from this level we'll be looking at 1.1664 as our next level of support next buying opportunity based on a couple of different support and resistance levels we have in the past here on the euro dollar and below that we have 1.1453. Now that's probably pretty far away in terms of when we get there so let's just focus on these top two levels for now. Also as resistance we have the same 1.2057 level that we previously have found as resistance right back here on this market and above that if we get some kind of rally out of the euro dollar not very likely but possible. The next level we'll be looking for for resistance is 1.2295. So those are my two resistance and my two support levels for the euro dollar. Now let's take a look at what our initial bias is on this pair. What are we looking for out of this market currently throughout this week in particular? Well as I was talking about just a second ago we have this 1.1871 support level that looks as though it's being pushed below. It doesn't like the markets respecting this level at the moment so if we take that down to a lower time frame let's jump down to a four hour chart. As you can see this four hour candle looking as though it's going to close bearish in the next about 20 minutes here on the euro dollar and if we do get a close that close is going to be below our most previous support level right here. And if this close happens to be below this previous support level then my initial bias in my bias for this week only euro dollar will be bearish. I'll be looking for short trades down into the 1.1664 level as I said unless we close back above this 1.1871 level before the end of the day. So how can we get involved knowing that short bias that we have? Well we can look for a few different things out of this market including some kind of retracement to get involved going short and there is a situation where we don't get a retracement at all and this market continues lower. In that case we may look on some lower time frames for a way to get involved in the bearish direction here on the euro dollar. So that's what we're paying attention to here only euro dollar and that's how we plan to trade the euro dollar throughout the rest of this week. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. Alright guys so here we are on the Aussie dollar the next pair we're going to take a look at and what we'll do is go ahead and discuss the key levels of structure for this market as for support we're getting pretty close to this 0.7898 level. That's a level we can actually look at and consider buying opportunities from if we get down to that level and if we get an entry reason. Important to remember that part guys if we just get down to that level it's not very significant unless you get some kind of entry reason based on your trading plan. Now below that level for support the market passes that level and continues down then we're going to be looking at 0.7821 as the next level of support for the Aussie dollar. Now as for resistance if we get some kind of rally out of this market we'll be looking at 0.8020 as our first level of resistance here on the Aussie dollar and above that we're going to be looking at 0.8105 as the next level of resistance for shorting opportunities. Now this market has had a very difficult time staying above the 0.805 level. As you can see every time the markets tried to pass that level we had a wick here push up and then pushed back down we had a rally from this market long with the top and a push back down from the 0.805 level and then another wick pushed above and sold off back down from that level. And previously before that this market was actually in a pretty strong uptrend. So with that being the case guys as it sits right now my current bias for the Aussie dollar is that I don't have a bias and that's okay. It's okay not to know which direction this market is going to go. These are the times when a trader must learn to sit on his hands and not place a trade if the market looks unpredictable and this is unpredictable market structure according to my trading plans and according to the way I read the market. So for that reason I'm not going to be placing a trade on the Aussie dollar unless we get some kind of move guys I want to see this market do something first and show me which direction it wants to go. Something like pushing down to this support level and then putting in some kind of entry reason or pushing below that support level and putting in some kind of entry reason or a rally out of this market to this resistance and some kind of entry reason from there until one of those two things happens I really do not have a bias on the Aussie dollar for this week. So we'll keep an eye on this and see what happens with this market whether it pushes down further to our support levels or rallies up to a resistance level. Now once we break through one of those levels we can look for some trade continuation on lower timeframes down to our next levels of support and resistance but that's a little more advanced than I like talking about here on YouTube so what we're going to do is go ahead and move on to our next pair that's what we're predicting out of the Aussie dollar. Next up we're going to take a look at the pound dollar. Alright traders let's talk about the pound here we are on the pound dollar daily chart and I'll go ahead and point out some levels of structure that we'll be paying attention to do for trading opportunities for support we're actually right around the 1.3448. 4.0 level I really like this level as support I like it as a place to look for some buying opportunities on lower timeframes and we'll discuss a little more about that in just a second but for our next level of support if we get a break below that level we can be looking down here at the 1.3233 zone for some kind of buying opportunities as well and as for resistance if we get a rally or a push above from this 1.3440 level from here we get a push above we can look for our next resistance level around 1.3853 and above that level we can look around the 1.4090 level so that's what we can look at for the distant future let's go ahead and talk about our current bias and our current predictions here on the pound dollar and guys when I say bias I just mean whether or not I'm looking for the market to head higher or head lower so which one of those we're expecting out of the pound dollar let's go ahead and take it down to a 4 hour chart and talk about it here we are on that 4 hour chart guys and as I said I really like this level as a level to be looking for long opportunities now of course there is a chance that we break right below that level but according to the daily chart analysis we should see this market head higher of course we could see a little bit deeper of a retracement than this but this is going to be our first stop our first level where we start to look for some buying potential down on lower time frames now we're not getting any kind of buying signal as of right now and if we don't then we're not going to be taking this market long but if we get a signal based on our trading plan to actually go long based on some of those EAP entry reasons that we teach in the training program that we may go ahead and take this as a long trade here on the pound dollar as for right now looking for long trades out of the pound dollar right here at this support level and there is another scenario where our bias reverses so right now looking for long trades but if we get a pretty decent close below that level we're going to immediately switch that bias to short and be trying to take short trades all the way down to 1.3, 2, 3, 3 level here on the pound dollar so that's what we're looking at here on the pound dollar and actually let me go ahead and talk a little more about why I'm interested in a long opportunity from this level not only is it because this is a major level of daily support and resistance that's been respected as structure in the past so we know there's a pretty high likelihood chance that we see some kind of movement off of this level but with that being the case and also being able to put our stop loss just below this little area of consolidation and support down here would put our stop right around that area and knowing that we can take targets off just below this next level of resistance gives us a great risk reward possibility on this trade so we know we have a lot of room to the upside on this market based on our structure analysis out on the higher time frames but that's all for the pound dollar let's go ahead and move on we're going to take a look at our next pair which is going to be the dollar yen alright so what's going on here on the dollar yen we're on the daily chart right now we're looking at this level of resistance at one twelve point oh two eight the market pushed above that level closed above that level and now is actually pulled back below it so does that give us a short or long bias well in order to determine that we have to look at what this market did most previously we have this rally and I know I have a lot of lines on my chart guys that may make this a little difficult to see but we have this rally that broke above this resistance level putting us into what could be a new bullish trend so because our most previous break of structure was to the upside was a bullish break of a previous resistance level and actually a couple of different previous resistance levels because of that and because we just closed above that daily important structure level we're actually looking at this as a long bias we're going to be looking for possible long trades down on lower time frames so before we do that let's go ahead and discuss some of these structure levels and the spots that we'll be paying attention to for trading opportunities in the distant future a little more towards the immediate future we have the 111.09 zone and I'm actually going to take you guys down to a smaller time frame and discuss a trading opportunity that we're going to have at that level but if the market breaks below that level the next level we'll be looking at for support is 108.97 now for resistance we do have this 112.028 and we could see a continuation down from this level of resistance and if we do get this rally that we're expecting out of the dollar in then what we can see is the next level of resistance being at 114.18 that's going to line up really well with this previous resistance levels back here so that's some of the levels we're going to be paying attention to but now let's go ahead and head down to a smaller time frame down to the one hour chart I'm going to show you guys a trading opportunity that I'm actually paying attention to alright guys so here we are on that one hour chart and do you guys notice anything that looks interesting about this chart well of course we have this 111.09 area this is a level where the market has found support and resistance in the past and it's a level we pointed out is a key level of structure that the market may respect once more well I'll give you guys a hint there's also an advanced pattern ending pretty close to this level so for those of you who are familiar with advanced patterns go ahead and see if you can spot it did you guys spot this Gartley pattern here we have an X to A move that has a 618 retracement followed by more than a 618 retracement backup towards A from B to C and now we're just waiting on that completion point so let's go ahead and draw this pattern in and as you can see once I draw it in we have a completion of this Gartley pattern very close to our 111.09 major level of structure so I'll go ahead and put on a long position tool we're going to have our stop loss below this major level of structure and we are going to have profits sitting around the 382 level for first targets and for second targets we'll be looking for trink continuation out of this pair so that is our most recent analysis here on the dollar yen and what we're expecting out of this pair we'll be keeping now in this pair and seeing if this advanced pattern does complete here on the dollar yen but for now let's go ahead and move on to our next pair and final pair of this video which is going to be on the dollar swiss alright guys so let's talk dollar swiss and what a messy chart am I right this market been pushing down and then down and then finally push back up breaking resistance before pushing back down breaking support before pushing back up and breaking resistance very serious form of consolidation at this point here on the dollar swiss and we have push back up to our most recent resistance level right here and actually had a nice push down from that level but similar to the Aussie dollar guys there's not really a good bias for this pair not looking for long or short trades unless this pair shows me something at one of these other levels this line here actually needs to be changed to blue for support and that is going to be the first thing that we're looking for here out of the dollar swiss I want to see this market push down at least to that 0.96 to 8 level and show me that we can see some buying pressure show me that we have some potential buyers for this market at that level that'll be the first thing I'm looking for but if we push below that level then I'll be waiting to see if we get buying pressure from 0.9558 I'll be looking at that zone for potential buying opportunities and as for resistance if we get a push back up to the 0.9747 level that is already acted as resistance multiple times in the past then I'll be looking for shorting opportunities on lower time frames from that level and if we get a push that rallies above that level then I'll be looking for more shorting opportunities around 0.9869 as I said guys as for right now similar to the Aussie dollar we don't really have a bias on this dollar swiss pair because as you can see this one daily candle touched our level of resistance and pushed all the way down and almost touched that next level of support that's over 100 pips away so no real clear direction out of the dollar swiss but that's what we're paying attention to for the future of this pair is to see if we can get a test of one of these major levels of structure and possibly get an entry reason off of them all right guys so that's going to do it
