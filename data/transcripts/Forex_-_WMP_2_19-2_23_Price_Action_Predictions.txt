Hey traders welcome to another weekly market predictions video my name is Stephen I'm a professional trader and a trading coach here at the trading channel and if you're new to the channel You're probably thinking why should I stick around for this video? Well last week in this same type of weekly market prediction video we come out with each and every Monday We predicted a rally from the 1.3829 level on the pound dollar We predicted this rally would make it up to this previous red line at 1.4 91 and this rally was over 260 pips We predicted that after the market got to 1.4091 we would see a fall in this market and so far this has been over a 115 pip fall from that level and I'm not just telling you guys this after the intro and disclaimer I'll be showing you a clip from last week's video proving that these are the predictions we made last week on this pair And that is all the more reason to make sure that you're subscribed here to the trading channel Make sure to click that notification bell and these markets move rather quickly So if you would like to be alerted first about our weekly market predictions whenever we come out with predictions like this telling you guys the levels we're looking at And how we plan to take advantage of the market if it gets to those levels then make sure you head over to www.thedingchannel.net and sign up for our email list as well While you do that, I'm going to let the intro and disclaimer roll Go ahead and click that like button for us to help support the channel and when we get back We'll take a look at that clip from last week on the pound dollar What we were talking about the market respecting these two levels. So I'll see you guys on the other side So for me though what i'm looking for here on the pound dollar is long opportunities And I see a really good area to look for those opportunities on the chart now It's at 1.3829 right where the market is hovering around on lower time frames I'll be looking for some kind of long opportunity from this level now We could see this market push all the way up to 1.40 9-1 and although the market would still be considered in an uptrend at that point This is an area I would look for counter trends short opportunities at this major level of structure in here Right around the neckline of this double top. So that'll be the first place we're looking for short opportunities is around 1.4091 So traders back here on this pound dollar chart and as you can see we had a nice bounce out of our 1.38 36th level right here that we expected from last week's video Once we got up to the 1.4091 level that we were talking about last week becoming resistance That's exactly what the market did is it became resistance and for any of you who are new here to the video I produce these videos each and every Monday mostly for people who are already subscribed But if you're new, I really appreciate you being here and I want to go ahead and explain to you what the blue and red lines are on your screen These blue and red lines that you see are important levels of structure For me, I identify important levels of structure in the market by looking back in the past and finding Levels in the market that have been used by the market as support or resistance multiple times So that's all these red and blue lines indicate and that's how we're predicting these market moves with them And for those of you who are returning subscribers, thank you for being here as well And let's go ahead and talk about what happened around these important areas of structure So for the pound dollar, let's go ahead and go down to an hourly chart We actually had some pretty good situations on an hourly chart to get involved around the 1.38 36th level. I'll point out a couple of those now And for any of you who are familiar with advanced patterns See if you can point out a couple of advanced patterns before I do here on the chart in front of you So here on this chart, we have two different advanced patterns. One of them is the ab fp This is a pattern that is similar to the advanced butterfly And it looks something like this coming in really close to that 1.3836 level right at that level of previous structure What we also have here is another advanced pattern Called the abt Which is similar to the advanced bat Coming in right here So two separate advanced patterns coming in right at this area We pointed out last week as an area we thought the market could see some support from and as you can tell that analysis worked out really Well, where we find these key and important levels of structure They oftentimes end up being really accurate market predictions And if you've been watching these weekly market predictions for a while I'm sure you've realized that by now But when things really get powerful is whenever you add these really accurate prediction levels with really accurate Entry reasons so here on the pound dollar. That's what we were looking at around these levels around the 1.3836 level Go and delete these Head back out to the four hour time frame and as you can see here on the four hour time frame the market got up to this level Pushed a little bit above it with these four hour candles and then back below That 1.40 9 1 level showing that that was a major level of resistance the market wanted to respect now Let's head back out to a daily chart. Let's talk about what we're expecting out of the pound dollar now Well at this point in the middle of nowhere after we've already seen a bounce off of this level at 1.40 9 1 we're not really looking for a trading opportunity right here What we're going to do is be waiting to see if this market comes up and retests that level if we get that retest We'll look for counter trend shorting opportunities on lower time frames or that push higher Is probably going to come up around our 1.43 even handle that'll be the next place We look for possible counter trend opportunities here on the pound dollar now when it comes to trend continuation We're going to be looking for a couple of different things here as well One would be a push down all the way to our previous level of support at 1.3836 where we found support last week If we get down to this level, we'll definitely be looking for long opportunities in trend continuation Here on the pound dollar and the other trend continuation situation is if we get a push above This level of resistance we do not get some kind of entry reason or if we do get an entry reason we get stopped out of that Stopped out of that trade above this resistance level once we get above that resistance level We'll be going to lower time frames and looking for long trades up to that 1.43 even handled number So those are our more immediate predictions here on the pound dollar one of those three situations is what we're looking for in the Very near future other than that we'll be paying attention down here at 1.3597 if we get a major push down for Some possible long opportunities and if we get a major push up we'll be looking at 1.4409 for possible resistance So that's what we're looking for here on the pound dollar. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair Which is going to be the dollar yen? Okay. Yeah, so here on the dollar yen we have a pretty massive downtrend happening Been in a downtrend since the 114 even handle level So since 114 All we've seen is this market push down create a new lower low compared to this previous low right back here We have this new low the pullback which created a new lower high Another down Move that created a lower low Then trend continuation to the downside before we push back up in the 110.48 level in it Last week maybe two weeks ago. Can't really remember We were looking at this level and we said we could definitely see some trend continuation Out of the zone we talked about that in a couple of weeks ago in the weekly market prediction video You can go back and look through the videos to find that one It was just a couple of videos back, but although we were expecting trend continuation from that level I didn't really expect a 500 pip drop from that zone. That's exactly what we got Well, we were actually expecting us some trend continuation down and we expected to get a pretty nice bounce out of this 107.46 level This was our next level possible support. We were looking at we actually got a losing trade out of this level We had an entry reason based on the eap entry and we ended up losing this trade But what did we do after we lost guys? We don't sit and talk about it all we do is prepare for the next trade So we lost a trade here at 107.46 the only thing we did was point out our next level of major structure Which was at 105.68 what did the market do came down to 105.68 and his since then had over a 100 pip push up from that level So remember whenever you lose a trade not to get super frustrated with yourself It happens to all traders professional not professional it happens to everyone everyone's going to lose trades You need to be disciplined enough to just move on from it Let it go and prepare for your next opportunity. So speaking of that What are we expecting out of the dollar yen throughout the rest of this week? And what are we expecting next out of this pair? Well Our ideal situation is trend continuation out of this pair We want to see this market continue lower But is that going to happen from where we are now? Well, there's no way to really know Another ideal situation would be a pullback up into 107.46 So that pullback up into 107.46 would prove to be a really nice place To start looking for some short opportunities out of the dollar yen And that's going to be one of the first things we're looking for out of this pair this week is a pullback up into the 107.46 area Before we start looking for some shorting opportunities This market will still be in a downtrend though Even if we make it all the way up to 108.74 because of this massive move down we've had so our second scenario is we make it up to 108.7 And we see some kind of short entry from that level Another thing we can look out for this week is a push down Towards 105.68 if we get back down to that level and we get a really good entry reason We can take that as a long trade from that level But more than likely we will not be getting any kind of really good entries and from that level because what we're really expecting is some trend Continuation out of this pair if we get that trend continuation the next level of support will look at is 103.93 And those are our four major levels of structure that we're looking at On the dollar yen for the upcoming week. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. The next pair We're going to take a look at today is going to be the aussie dollar Here on the aussie dollar We have a situation that I don't really like to trade in and let let me explain a little bit more about that So we have a lot of structure levels that are very close together a lot of Previously important structure levels that are very close together meaning that they could act as major structure again now And the problem with that is these tight ranges we have this range here from one structure level up to the next It's only like 60 something pips. So with these tight ranges it makes it hard to get multiple targets And I do trade a two target system So that's a very difficult thing for me to make profits with when a market's in a tight range like this Another thing we have going against is that this market isn't really in any type of trend Now we were in a previous uptrend here on the aussie dollar. We had a high A higher low and a new higher high Then the market breaks and closes below the previous higher low now that in itself for me and my analysis does not put us in a down trend But it also takes us out of being in an uptrend as well Although we did find some port from this area. So since we found support from this area My initial bias would be long And with that being the case I would be looking for long trades at our previous level of structure right 0.789 3 the only problem is looking for long trades there Means that my targets would have to come off around the 0.7 957 level or that's where I'd be looking at for The targets on my position and that's such a small range again looking for long trades from here up to here is only about 60 pips Of potential profit. So that's why I'm not really looking for any type of trading opportunity here on the aussie dollar As I said my initial bias would be long trades looking for a push up And if we end up getting up here to 0.8023 I will look for short trades in that area This is on here is a little bit larger and if we push up up that I'll definitely be looking for short trades around 0.8117 As this zone is plenty big enough to find some extra targets out of now if we push down which is also possible I'll be looking around 0.7 806 for possible long opportunities And if we push down below that going into actual down trends if we get a breaking close below this previous low Then our first counter trend opportunity will be at 0.7730 So again, not really looking for any trading opportunities here on the aussie dollar as of right now based on this daily chart analysis But that's what we're looking at going into the future on this pair Now we'll go ahead and head down to the dollar swiss and take a look at what we're expecting out of this pair next The dollar swiss another pair that's been in a pretty massive downtrend since about the one dollar even handle right right at that one dollar Even handle we started this downtrend looking at a low a lower high A lower low lower high lower low lower high Continuing that downtrend to our lower low here We got a nice bounce out of that area a couple of weeks ago from a previous weekly market predictions video and we talked about Though 0.9 446 level was being an area that could push this market down into trading continuation We were expecting that level to push the market down to break below these previous lows We talked about that a couple of weeks back as well. I think in the same video of that aussie dollar So I actually put a card in the top right hand corner of the screen for that video So you can check it out but as you can see we did get some trend continuation out of the pair from that area We actually Upon this trend continuation expected a little more of a bounce from the 0.9 to 9 3 level before continuing down Unfortunately, we did not get that bounce, but we didn't have any kind of entry reason there So we didn't end up losing a trade based on that analysis But we did expect some kind of bounce from the 0.9 to 9 3 because that it's a major level of structure Looking left. So now what are we expecting? Well now we got this breaking close below our previous low We got a breaking close below the 0.9 to 9 3 area and we have a pullback into that area what we're expecting is some trend continuation out of this market expecting a push down from this level now We have not yet got any kind of entry reason and if this candle closes above that level and we continue to see Some pushes above the 0.9 to 9 3 then we won't be looking for any kind of shorting opportunity unless This current candle is pushed down and closes below our 0.9 to 9 3 zone If that's the case we will be looking for shorting opportunities and we'll be looking for those shorting opportunities to push the market down to 0.9 163 so that's our initial bias here on the dollar swiss is looking to see if this current candle closes below Our current major level of structure to see if we can start looking for some short trays out of this pair The next thing we expect to happen is a possible push up to 0.9 385 if we get that push up to 0.9 385 we'll start looking there for possible shorting opportunities and if we get above that we'll look back at these previous highs here for Our next trend continuation shorting opportunities at 0.9 446 another possible scenario if we get this push down from any of these levels like we expect to see in Continuation then the next level we'll look at for counter trend long opportunities is 0.9 163 if the market gets there that's what we can look for in that area is some possible long opportunities to push the market up as a Counter trend trade and below that at 0.9 0.9 so there are levels of structure for the dollar swiss that we're paying attention to in the future again that immediate bias being Short trades based on what we see trend wise here on the daily chart So guys if this was valuable to you and you'd like to learn more about how we spot these structure levels not only that But more about how we make these exact predictions place entries around these structure levels and some of our other strategies that we use here at the trading channel Then feel free to click the link in the description labeled ea p training program Also for any of you who are interested in advanced patterns are interested in trying to learn how to trade those patterns We're actually about to come out with something pretty big here at the trading channel that will involve one of the most cost efficient ways For you to learn the profitable technique of trading advanced patterns.
