This is a pretty messy chart This pair not really giving any kind of clear directional moves when it comes to trend as with many other charts The euro dollar pair is in a period of consolidation here towards the end of the year But that doesn't mean that there's not gonna be any kind of trading opportunities on this pair That just means that directional moves are gonna be a little bit more difficult to predict But the good thing is with that being the case these major levels of daily structure support and resistance tend to be pretty powerful So for the euro dollar last week we talked about wanting to go short on this market all the way down to this 1.1686 level Somewhere in this yellow zone is where we were talking about the market possibly finding some support last week We ended up getting close to that zone and the market did find some support pushing us back up to our previous Resistance level at 1.1859 this level of resistance last week is an area we talked about possibly going short on this market And we actually had a pretty nice short trade based on this analysis in the EAP So we sent out email analysis on Monday on this euro dollar pair on a trade based on this analysis And I'll put a screenshot of that up for you guys to see it real quick So after last week's analysis playing out now, what are we expecting for this current week here out of the euro dollar? Well currently we're looking for a couple of different things out of this pair as I said We're not really looking at this as being in any type of trend because the market overall is just consolidating So if we can see this market come up into a major level of resistance or support We're gonna be paying attention there for trading opportunities based on those levels So if we get up to the 1.1859 level again We'll be looking at that area for a potential shorting opportunity If we get some kind of entry reason on a lower timeframe if we are pushed down from that level We'll be looking down here in our yellow zone For a potential buying opportunity around the 1.1686 area breaking below that We have a long ways to go we can look for some shorting opportunities in through here all the way down near the 1.1453 area that's on the next level support that we see as a major level and that we can look for Some type of long opportunities from now. We can also look for long opportunities around the 1.157 level this area of standalone support here Now if this market breaks above our resistance level around the 1.1859 then that level will become support in the next level We're looking at for possible resistance after our 1.195 area right here the standalone resistance will be the next standalone resistance we have looking left around 1.2060 So this week on the euro dollar not really any type of directional bias based on trend because of the fact that we're in a period of Consolidation but we're still paying attention to these key levels to see if we can get some trading opportunities based on entry reasons down on lower time frames Around those levels. I do want to pay attention to one more thing We have on a lower time frame here on the euro dollar if we take this market all the way down to the hourly chart and I zoom in Do you guys see any type of potential trading opportunity to the downside close to our resistance level? If you're familiar with advanced patterns, then hopefully you saw this advanced cipher pattern if we pull from our x-leg up here Down to a you know is more than a 382 retracement, which gives us a cipher pattern possibility. We get this extension down here They gave us more than a 127 extension and now we're just paying attention to this market waiting on a 786 retracement For our advanced pattern completion for this cipher pattern And as you can see this specific advanced pattern coming in pretty close to our Daily resistance zone the good thing about it It's if this does field then our stop loss will be directly above that daily zone So this is a potential shorting opportunity for those of you with advanced patterns in your trading plan and also with daily levels of Structure in your trading plan. So there's something to pay attention to here for the euro dollar Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. The next pair we're gonna look at today is gonna be the pound dollar We'll zoom back out to the daily chart and guys our analysis from last week on this pair actually played out perfectly Last week we discussed the 1.3305 level as being a possible level of support We could see the market get a good bounce off of looking in this zone We got that bounce. We also talked about the 1.34 4 levels being possible resistance We got some good trades off of that to the downside the market then came back down into our major support level around 1.3305 And since then we've seen a major bounce from this level So what we're going to do first is take a look at last week's analysis on this pair And then we'll come back and discuss a little more about the pound dollar So the pound dollar here is actually pretty interesting. We're heading down towards this zone of consolidation We had back here our resistance level for this period of consolidation. We had a couple of months ago I think this will prove to be a powerful level for the pound dollar I think we'll get down in this level and probably see some support a pretty nice bounce out of this market from that level So as for our first level of support we're looking for and the more immediate future for the pound dollar Our prediction is the market coming down into the 1.3305 to the 1.32 4.6 area and that levels where we expect this market to find a little bit of support as for resistance If we get a nice push up back to the 1.3449 area that area will look at four possible resistance to go short on this pound dollar pair but So traders as you can see last week's analysis playing out really well here on the pound dollar So now let's take a look at what we're expecting next out of this pair Before we do that if you think this analysis would be beneficial to your trading and you're interested in staying up to date When we come out with these weekly market prediction videos Then you need to do two different things You need to make sure that you're subscribed here to the trading channel if you're new and watching a video from us for the first time Make sure you click the notification bell beside that subscribe button and also you can sign up for our email list We send out notifications first to people signed up for that email list and doing those things We'll assure that you're notified whenever we come out with these weekly market prediction videos So for the pound dollar very similar to the euro dollar We're going to be paying attention to these key levels of structure because this market currently is not really giving us a clear direction When it comes to trend we do have uh this market just now breaking above this previous resistance level And this is definitely a bullish sign the market being able to produce this very bullish Impulsive move to the upside breaking above this resistance along with this other daily resistance level with our red line here But we do have this level of resistance looking left and this level of support looking left staying in between those levels means that this pair is going to be in a Period of consolidation until we break out of one of those two zones So that being the case just as with the euro dollar what we're going to be looking for yet again is a push up to our resistance level around 1.3441 Right in that area is where we can look at for possible resistance Shorting opportunities if we break above that level we'll be looking back here at the standalone level of resistance around 1.35 9.7 that's the next level we can look at for possible shorting opportunities now when it comes to support we can see this market pushed down If we do this zone is yet again another place we're going to be looking at for long opportunities to the upside around 1.3305 Between that and 1.3246 if we push below that we have a pretty long ways to go down to 1.3056 for our next level of possible support Out of the pound dollar. So that's what we're paying attention to for the future here on the pound dollar Our first level of resistance is what we're paying attention to most right around in here We're going to be looking there for possible shorting opportunities Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair which will be the dollar Swiss here on the dollar Swiss not much has changed since last week We have our same levels of structure. We're gonna be taking a look at for trading opportunities right now hovering around that level of support We've been pointing out for the last couple of weeks around a 0.9857 level So what we're looking for here is some type of trading opportunity to give us a indication the market could go long from this area If we get that we'll take a long position out for resistance We're looking back here at this previous level Which is also acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past at 0.9945 Now if the market breaks above that level we'll be looking back here at our standalone resistance level around 1.005 For our next level of resistance breaking above that means we'll get up to the 1.0089 around the 1.01 even handle number For our next resistance level where we look for possible shorting opportunities out of the dollar Swiss Now other than the area we're in right now that we're looking at as support if this market continues in the downward direction We'll be looking around 0.9740 for our next level of support here on the dollar Swiss the reason for that is because that is a level that's acted as support And resistance multiple times in the past. So if the market gets to that level again, it's definitely level we're interested in paying attention to for possible trading opportunities So that's it for the dollar Swiss. We'll go ahead and move on to our next pair Which is gonna be the dollar yen last week here on the dollar yen We had a market that pushed right above this 113 even handle once we pushed above that We actually expected this level to hold as support if we got to pull back back into that zone We were looking down on lower time frame for some kind of trading opportunity We never got one so no trade was taken based on that analysis But now we've actually pushed below that 113 even handle meaning that it turns back into resistance and what we're waiting for this We can see if this market will pull back up into the 113 even handle and give us some reason to jump on the next move down Out of the dollar yen So that's what we're looking for initially if we get some kind of push down or if this market just turns and pushes down from where it's at Now we'll be looking around the 112 even handle between that and 111.79 for our first level of support breaking below that We'll look at the standalone level right here around 111 even if you notice this dollar yen pair has been respecting even handle numbers like 111 114 and even 115 back in the past very often So that's telling us that this is a pair that really respects these even handle numbers And we can use those numbers to our advantage because of that So around that 111 even where this other support level over here the standalone level is It's the next level we'll look for lower opportunities on the dollar yen right below that at 110 five now as for resistance other than the market making it to the 113 even handling giving us a reason to go short If we break above that we can look here around the 113 five Area with the standalone resistance to our left if we get above that we're looking at 114.23 as our next level of resistance for the dollar yen And that's what we're going to be paying attention to on this pair for the remainder of this week We'll go ahead and move on to our next pair and the final pair of the video which is going to be the Aussie dollar So on the Aussie dollar we were waiting on this pair to break out of this period of consolidation that we had been in for around a month And last week we actually got that breakout. We got that breakout initially to the downside here with this move Pushing down and breaking below our previous level of structure support round 0.7532 directly following that this market actually pushed up And then broke back up above our previous resistance level around 0.7627 So with that being the case now we are looking for long trades here only Aussie dollar now of course Overall looking left to right this market still seems to be in a downtrend But we have this initial hint that the market could be putting in some type of reversal That hint is the fact that we've just broken above these two levels of resistance back here And also this being a major level of resistance and support major level of structure out here on the daily chart This blue line we have so the market breaking above those what looks like quite easily because of those factors We're waiting on long trades out of the Aussie dollar Possibly long trades up to our next level of resistance looking left which is previous support along with major structure multiple other times looking left Around the 0.7730 level if the market makes it past that level the next level of resistance We're going to look at is this previous level this act is a support and resistance multiple times in the past around 0.7819 Now as for support this market could possibly pull back into the 0.7627 area if that happens Will you looking there for long opportunities? Especially considering that we've just broken out to the upside here on the Aussie dollar if we push a little bit lower than that We can look for possible support around the 0.7583 level that'll be the next level of support We're looking for here out of the Aussie dollar so traders. I want to end today's video with this Creating a profitable trading strategy is difficult Understanding every aspect of technical analysis is also very difficult. These are both going to be very time-consuming processes in your trading career You can speed that up a little by taking some kind of training program that offers their strategies to you and offers training on technical analysis But by far the most difficult part of trading goes beyond technical analysis The most difficult part is going to be understanding and implementing risk management and discipline into your trading And if you're still here then make sure you keep watching because this is extremely important information And I know that if you've seen a few of my videos or if you're a returning subscriber You've heard me harp about risk management and discipline many many times before and I don't want you to think that it's just me saying these things I want you to hear it from actual traders who have went through the process from maybe at the stage you are now struggling as a trader Maybe you're losing money in the markets or maybe you're just frustrated because you haven't been able to become quite profitable yet Two actually becoming consistently profitable. I received an email a couple of days ago from a trader who was actually able to make that jump His name was Ryan Ryan's been a member of the eap training program for some time now And I'd like to share his email with you because it helps to solidify the fact that risk management and discipline are going to be the two Main points in your trading that are hardest to overcome. So let me go ahead and share Ryan's email with you Ryan says hi there, steven Unfortunately, I'm looking to cancel my membership. However, this is due to no other reason than I am now a profitable trader And i've been following my plan for some time I would also like to add the following. Can I say my journey to where I am now would not have been anywhere near as painless without your guidance and teachings My basic understanding of trading came from your youtube videos a year ago Which helped me build a good solid foundation of trading knowledge The eap training program and techniques you use have helped form the main blocks of how I trade today Very well presented very easy to understand Finally, I would like to add that one of the major key points that has helped me through Is definitely watching your equity curve and realizing that even professional traders have drawdowns This got me out of the get rich quick mindset early on Thankfully and ryan if you're watching this, I want to say great job I'm very proud of you make sure to keep in touch and I wish you all the best for your future as well So to sum up ryan's email watching the equity curve that he sees whenever we do the eap review videos each week Taught him a little more about discipline taught him about risk management taught him that even professional traders have drawdowns And with that being the case he started to understand that him having drawdowns was okay too See the reason a lot of traders fail is because they end up losing a few trades While they're trading a strategy and because of the fact they haven't back tested that strategy that don't understand discipline And the fact that they have to stick to a strategy through a drawdown They end up switching strategies and going somewhere else over and over and over until they slowly bleed their account dry This is a very unfortunate part of trading and something I want to help every trader avoid That's why I mentioned this in so many of my videos Now for those of you who are ready to invest in your forex trading education for this next week only We are going to be doing a 30 percent off christmas sale on the lifetime membership on the eap training program So if you would like to get involved in that with that discount then you can just click the link in the description labeled eap training program Now if you're not ready to invest in your education yet as a trader Maybe you're somebody just starting out you don't even know if you're going to be continuing to trade and pursue this as a career If that's the case that's okay too.
