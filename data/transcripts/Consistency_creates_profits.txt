You do not create trading opportunities. I do not create trading opportunities as a professional trader. I take the opportunities that the market, the charts, the pairs that I'm trading give me. If there's a day that prices aren't doing what you need them to in order to create your perfect trading opportunity based on your strategy, your job as a professional trader is to sit on your hands and not trade anything. Don't trade if you don't have the opportunity to trade. You creating a trading opportunity is called you breaking your rules. What we do as traders is we wait for opportunities to present themselves to us based on a tested and proven to be profitable trading strategy and trading plan.
