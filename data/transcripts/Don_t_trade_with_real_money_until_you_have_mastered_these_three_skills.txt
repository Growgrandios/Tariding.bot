Trading is about finding a specific rules-based strategy that you can place and trade over and over. As we discussed a little bit earlier in the lesson, 40% chance to win 2.5 to 1 reward to risk ratio over a long period of time gives an 80% ROI with a 2% risk. The way we create that statistic advantage is by understanding major levels of structure, understanding time-tested chart patterns like ascending wedges, double bottoms, double tops, a head and shoulders pattern, understanding how to place a stop and target correctly over time. Be sure you have a good handle on technical analysis, stop-starts, risk management, trading psychology and discipline until you are a master of all of those. In my opinion, it is a mistake for you to be placing trades with real money.
