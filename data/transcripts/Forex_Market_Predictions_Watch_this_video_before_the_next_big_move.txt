What's up traders welcome to the trading channel welcome to today's video today We're gonna be talking about the euro dollar and the Aussie dollar the euro dollars actually just come up to a level of resistance That we pointed out in last week's structure based trading episode 8 video If you'd like to see that full video link will be in the description along within the top right hand corner of your screen Today we're gonna be talking a little bit about what happened to that resistance level and also what we think might happen later On this week and into next week here on the euro dollar along with the same type of analysis On the Aussie dollar pointing out the key levels of structure and how I plan to take advantage of the market at these key levels So if you're interested in seeing that then make sure you keep it locked through the intro and disclaimer Click that like button for me. Click subscribe if you're new to the channel and I'll see you guys on the other side Welcome back traders, so we're gonna start off today's analysis on the euro dollar and what we're trying to do in these structure based trading videos Is actually point out these key levels that the market has respected out on higher time frames multiple times like on the daily and weekly chart Because these levels are more likely to be respected on our trading time frames as support and resistance now It's not necessarily a great strategy or a great way to trade to just trade support and resistance You can get yourself in trouble just placing random limit orders at places in the market that have been respected before as support or resistance But if you have a certain technique or a certain strategy that you can incorporate these major levels of structure into Then it can be very beneficial for you to check out these videos So make sure that you are subscribed here to the trading channel in order to keep receiving content like this So as for the euro dollar This is a pair that we did take a look at last week in structure based trading episode eight and we discussed this 1.189 area as a resistance level and as an area where we expected the market to push into and Possibly see some resistance and fall from and guys as you can see that's exactly what's happened We've had a pretty nice little drop here from that area of resistance of around 200 pips And the reason we expected some type of fall from this area guys is because this was our next level of major support out here on This time frame so we had to look back pretty far to find a level of support that could possibly turn into resistance But if I zoom the chart out you can see here circled in this black line that This was our next level support that could possibly turn into resistance on the euro dollar So that being the case waiting for the market to get to that level and we ended up taking targets off on a long Trade that we had previously using a flag pattern in through here to get involved long on the euro dollar And if we drop down you can see that there was actually a possible entry right at this area So let's take a look down on the one hour time frame So guys an example of using a technique or a strategy at these major levels of structure would be the fact that here at this level We have a very nice double top So let's say someone has a double top and double bottom strategy using that strategy out in the middle of nowhere Where there's no other structure looking left is probably not going to be a very profitable strategy But it makes a lot more sense to trade things like double tops or double bottoms at major levels of structure And as you can see guys here at this level the 1.189 level we discussed in structure based trading episode eight We did end up getting a nice little double top scenario, which could have made for a very nice trade So that's what happened on the euro dollar. That's in hindsight. That's trades that have already taken place Let's take a look at what could happen next here on the euro dollar So we zoom back out to the daily chart You can see that we have pushed down from that level of resistance and our next level of support is down at 1.1615 Right in this area is the level of support I'm talking about guys and so our next move on the euro dollar here the trading channels to wait for a push down Into that support level and to see if we can get some kind of entries and some kind of opportunity there and also Knowing that we just pushed pretty hard off this resistance level I think we can definitely see a test of that level and What does that tell us if we expect the market to get here? But it's here right now. What does that tell us? We have a short bias at the moment on the euro dollar meaning we're expecting this market to go lower before we push higher Now there's a possibility that we do push higher maybe even get back to this 1.19 area Maybe even push above it to the low 1.2s But for now we have a short bias on lower time frames because of this situation So how do we take advantage of that? Well, we go down to a lower time frame again and we prepare for the next leg down So the way we do this is we're waiting on some type of entry reason to go short here that can come if you've seen a few of our Other structure based trading videos that you know that we wait for certain entry reasons on the way down to this support level We've had some impulsive moves down so far that leads me to believe that will continue down to this level So I'll be paying attention here on the four hour and even down on the hourly chart for some reasons to get involved Going short on this euro dollar So that's what I'm looking at and that's what I'm looking for at the moment here on the euro dollar And of course if we do push down let's say we don't even get an entry reason instead the market just pushes straight down to that 1.16 zone Then I'll be looking for some kind of entry reason to push up from that zone being at a major level of support Now let's zoom back out to the daily chart and check out the other levels we'll be paying attention to it is possible that we break below the 1.16 area and We make it all the way down to that 1.14 5 zone and that's the next place we'll be looking for an opportunity to go long as a major level of support here at the trading channel Now if we get a retest of our resistance level here at 1.189 then we'll look for a Opportunity to go short and if we bust above that the next level of resistance will be looking at is the 1.204 zone For opportunities to go short here on the euro dollar So that's what we're looking at here on the euro as I said initially and for the time being my bias is short on this pair I'm be looking for reasons to ride this market down to the 1.1614 Area and if that opportunity presents itself it's something I will be taking advantage of so that the analysis break down here on the euro Dollar let's go ahead and move down one more pair and check out what could possibly happen next for the Aussie dollar based on this structure based Analysis here. We are on the Aussie dollar chart and as you can see similar thing happened last week here on this chart Market pushed up into a major level of resistance barely got touched there and then pushed down and we actually talked about this 0.789 zone Right here our first blue line being a level of possible support But there was no type of entry reason and that's something that's very important to remember guys these levels of support and resistance are not beneficial unless there's something that happens on a trading time frame Even something you've prepared for a Strategy or a technique that you've tested in the market and that's proven to be profitable at these levels That's what we're waiting on here at these major levels of support and resistance We're not just looking at these levels and when the market gets there placing a trade That is a very easy way to lose an entire account because as you can see the market pushes around these levels and goes above and below them And without an entry reason or some kind of strategy at this level you could be looking at a lot of losses So for the Aussie dollar what we're gonna be taking a look at is where the market is right now is a major level of Daily resistance that could turn into support so as the market keeps pushing down here We'll actually be looking for an opportunity to go long at this level and let's go ahead and drop down and see if we're getting any kind of Opportunity on a trading time frame Nope, it's a little bit too early here guys to be looking for any type of trading opportunity So over the next few hours and possibly even a couple of days we'll be seeing if this market consolidates here or Starts to put in some type of entry reason to the long side at this level of support other than that our Blue line above here that's been broken is now going to turn into resistance So if this market decides to push up what we'll be looking at is a resistance level at 0.7896 in that zone if we break above that we'll be looking again at our area of Resistance that's already been tested and proven to be a major level of resistance because it did push this Aussie dollar down in a major way and that'll be the next level resistance around the 0.80 0.806 zone it's gonna be a pretty large zone there that we'll be looking for short opportunities on the Aussie dollar now as far as next level of support. It's pretty easy to spot as you can see these multiple resistance levels in through here That's where we'll be looking for next long opportunity if this market does break through where we are currently if this market does break Through the 0.7808 zone like so then this is the next spot the next area The next zone that we'll be looking for a trading opportunity on the Aussie dollar So currently on the Aussie dollar I am going to have a long bias. I'm looking for long Opportunities only on the lower time frames on the trading time frames and this is going to be counter trend guys I know here on the daily chart We're definitely in an uptrend guys But if we just zoom down to one time frame lower which I use a four hour you can see this market has been breaking through support After support and creating lower highs as well So we have reversed and began a small downtrend here on the four hour time frame So if we place a trade on the four hour an hourly chart it will be a counter trend trade And we'll be looking to take targets off pretty quickly and we will not be looking for a move all the way up for our first Target now that would be a good spot to look for second targets on a trade if we get one down here at the 0.7808 Area but as for first targets will be looking for something much smaller on this counter trend opportunity So guys, that's what we're looking at this week and going into next week as well on the euro dollar and Aussie dollar If we get some kind of trading opportunity on either of these two pairs I'll go ahead and record that and post that as well So make sure you're subscribed here to be alerted when that video comes out Make sure to head over to the trading channel net and enter your email address here If you're interested in receiving more free educational material that I don't provide here on YouTube As well as receive alerts on these free educational videos.
