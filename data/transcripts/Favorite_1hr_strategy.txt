We're looking for a level of resistance that's been tested multiple times. As you can see here, we have this level. I'm going to drop down by one hour chart and just wait for price to create a double top with some type of candlestick pattern afterward. We'll go to three X again so I can catch it. We have that big move down. We have prices pushing back up now. And eventually we have this big push up. We have the neckline of the double top. We have prices pushing back up and eventually we get an engulfing candle right here at the second top at the top of our zone. So this gives me everything I need in order to place the trade. This trade so far has worked out really well.
