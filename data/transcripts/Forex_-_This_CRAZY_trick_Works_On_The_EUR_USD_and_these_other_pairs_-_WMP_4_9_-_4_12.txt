Last week on the euro dollar we made a prediction that this market would come down into the 1.2240 level and we would have a nice bounce out of this market from that level. This week this market pushed up over 150 pips from exactly where we expected. Last week here on the pound dollar we had a market in a downtrend just broke below the neckline of that head and shoulders pattern. We said we were waiting on the market to get back up to 1.4092 and at that neckline of our head and shoulders pattern is somewhere we would look for shorting opportunities to push this market down and break into new lows. In last week's prediction here on the dollar yen we said that after the close of last week and the completion of this head and shoulders pattern here on the daily chart signaling a reversal that we would see this market head higher before turning around. And also in last week's prediction video we predicted that the Aussie dollar would come down retest our previous structure lows and could get a nice rally from that level all the way up to the 0.777 area. It's exactly what we got we also predicted that the 0.777 area could be resistance for this Aussie dollar. So what's next for this pair that's something we're going to discuss directly after the intro and disclaimer. And guys this is something that works not only for the euro dollar or the top five major pairs but for every pair when it comes to making predictions and that is the approach of top-down analysis that we try to teach you guys each and every week through these weekly market prediction videos.

Click that like button for me and I'll see you guys on the other side. Alright traders so back here we're gonna start off on the euro dollar and not much has changed for this pair we are still in this period of consolidation. We've been looking at over the past couple of months now in between 1.25 and 1.22. So with that being the case the only thing that we're looking for out here on this high top frame is trades that are gonna be bouncing off of support or bouncing off resistance we had one of those last week just as we discussed before the intros what I'm gonna do is play you guys a clip from last week's video talking about this bounce off support we had and I'll be right back to talk about what we're expecting next out of this euro dollar pair and what we're expecting next out of the rest of the top five major pairs. So I go ahead and play that clip and I'll be right back. So for our initial predictions here on the euro dollar our initial trade idea is that this market pushes down just a little bit further into the 1.225 area and once we get down to that 1.225 area we can look for long trades based on the bounce off of this previous level of support. So that push off of support is exactly what we got coming out of last week's video and here on this euro dollar chart there's really no way for us to estimate or to guess what this market's going to do from exactly where it is now but that's okay because that's not our job as traders what our job is is not to be able to guess exactly what the market's going to do at any given point but to be prepared for whatever the market throws at us to be prepared for whatever the market does and so in this case what we're doing is preparing for what the market does by saying that if this market gets up to the 1.245 area we can get a push into that major resistance area then that's a place we can look for possible shorting opportunities and above that at around 1.25 even looking back at the previous highs of this period of consolidation something else that's possible and that could happen here on the euro dollars another pull back into the 1.225 area that being the case we can look yet again for possible long opportunities from there all the way down into our most previous lows here and of course we get a break below all of that then we'll look at our next support level around 1.2066 for possible support out of the euro dollar but really until we break out of this period of consolidation we're just looking for plays off of support and resistance out of this pair so next up let's go ahead and move on to our next pair which is going to be the dollar in okay guys here we are on the dollar and before we get started with the analysis on this pair throughout these weekly market prediction videos what we're really trying to do here at the trading channel is help you guys to understand how to make predictions about what the market is going to do instead of being in the mindset where you think that you're always going to be able to tell what the market is going to do no matter where the market is like we just looked at on the euro dollar you know if a market's in a period of consolidation and it's right in between it's right here let's say in that period consolidation there's no way for me as a professional trader to really understand or know what that market is going to do from that level when I say predictions the whole point of these videos is to show you guys that making predictions means that you're waiting patiently for a condition to be met before you even attempt to trade so what would an example of a condition be for the way we're trading during these weekly market prediction videos well up at previous resistance down at previous support that would be an example of the conditions that were waiting to be met in order for us to make our predictions because because the truth is as a trader you're not always going to know exactly what the market's going to do at any given moment again our purpose is not to know what the market's going to do but to prepare and predict based on conditions and a trading plan what the market's going to do so another thing to point out is the fact that just because we have these levels pointed out as major levels of support and resistance we're not just blindly placing trades every time the market gets there because that can lead to blowing an account that's not what we're doing here and that's not the purpose of these videos the purpose of these videos is to give you guys an extremely valuable skill of course it's valuable to be able to point out levels in the market that very commonly act as major levels of support and resistance as you guys have saw throughout these weekly market prediction videos and if you're new make sure to go back and watch a few of them using these levels to predict market moves can be a very valuable skill to add to your trading but still it's just a condition it's just a tool in the entire tool bag that you need in order to build your trading plan you can't build a house with nothing but a hammer you need an entire selection of tools in order to build that house and trading is no different you need an entire selection of conditions and entry reasons conditions and strategies along with rich management plans stop-laws placement target placement there's much more that goes into it than just pointing out key levels of structure but this is an extremely valuable skill that we try to help you guys improve each and every week with these weekly market prediction videos but again just really important to remember that this is not an entire trading plan in order for this to become an entire trading plan you need to match it with entry reasons stop-loss placement target placement risk management plan money management plan and much more last week we had a trade based off the entry reasons I'm talking about and based around an entire trading plan where we have a set stop-loss and a set target in the EAP training program along with a set risk management plan and this trade ended up working out and bank us in over 100 pips I'll put a screenshot of that trade to the left hand side of your screen so that trade banked in over 100 pips and it's just important for me to point out that it's not only because we use this major level of structure support that played a factor in the decision-making in the prediction and in the trade but that wasn't the only part that was a condition that was met before the rest of our trading plan came together and allowed us to actually place that trade and guys you can go out and use your own entry techniques create your own plans when it comes to stop-loss and target placement risk management and everything else included in a trading plan but if you'd like to save yourself some time then we offer some really advanced help with all of those including the strategies and entry reasons that we use here at the trading channel in the EAP training program there's a link for that in the description again you can go out there and do it yourself as well it's not something that you have to have a training course in order to accomplish but having a training course there having a mentor guide you through that process can make that process much easier and much faster but now that we've talked about needing to add other things to these major levels of structure let's go ahead and point out our major levels of structure and talk about what we're expecting out of the dollar yen coming into this next week so we have another major level of structure that is formed the reason is because we have one two three times the market has used this level as support and resistance now this market broke into new highs and pulled back directly to that level we're currently just hovering around this level at 106.82 but we will be looking on lower timeframes for possible entry reasons for that trading plan to come together on this dollar yen pair and give us a push-up because we are expecting this push-up to come into the 108 area right here at this previous major resistance combining that with these previous major support levels so that's initially what we're expecting out this pair and if we get some kind of entry reason that follows our trading plan down here on a lower time frame here on the dollar yen then we will be taking that as an opportunity to go along now what else could happen here we could see a push all the way back down to support keeping us in an uptrend because this market can be in an uptrend all the way back down to this support level or in a reversal situation this isn't really an uptrend yet but it is a reversal situation we need to be looking out for and we can stay in this mindset we can stay with this long bias until this market pulls all the way down and breaks below 105.69 so 105.69 will be another good place look for long opportunities if the market gets down into that level and of course our short trades this week or our possible short trades are if the market gets up into 108 between 108 and 108.2 that's an area in the market we'll take a look at for possible short opportunities here on the dollar yen and that's what we're looking at on this pair let's go ahead and move on to our next pair now which is going to be the dollar Swiss last week here on the dollar Swiss we were expecting this market to push up break into new house we had already broken a new house we expected a little bit more of a push up out of this pair to really break into some new highs and create this uptrend and then a pullback into our previous levels of resistance is something that we were talking about and something we were expecting out of this pair and anticipation for trend continuation out of the dollar Swiss well to this point nothing has changed we actually got exactly what we're looking for the market is now pulled back into the previous levels of resistance that were just broken pushing this market into new higher highs getting this pullback means that we're now waiting on lower time frames and we've already gotten a trade once out of this pair we ended up hitting our first targets and have now been stopped out for break even on the second part of that position but we will be continuing to look for possible long trades here on the dollar Swiss around this level because what we're expecting is at least a retest of this resistance level and possibly even trend continuation all the way up to 0.9684 out of this pair and if this market gets up to 0.9684 that's a level we can look for possible shorting opportunities with a counter trend mindset here on the dollar Swiss we can also look for those counter trend opportunities right back here at this previous resistance around 0.964 as for support lower down if we get a break below this support level we'll be looking all the way down here at 0.9648 on this pair for our next level of possible support here out of the dollar Swiss and that's what we're taking a look at on this pair we had move on now to our next pair which is going to be the pound dollar okay traders so here on the pound dollar we had a fantastic prediction that worked out really well last week we talked about this market coming into a reversal situation because of one our previous level of daily structure looking left right now we're on a four-hour chart we had that including that we also had a nice head and shoulders pattern with a breakout to the downside now we know with these conditions met the neckline of this head and shoulders pattern is a great place to start looking for possible trading opportunities to the downside for trend continuation based on this head and shoulders pattern this market then pushed up and gave us exactly what we're looking for with trend continuation breaking into new lows exactly as we expected I'm gonna play you guys a really quick clip from last week where we talked about this scenario and then we'll come back to talk about what we're expecting next here out of the pound dollar so let's take a look at that clip and I'll be right back and other than that we're looking for a pull back up into 1.4 1.0 for a possible shorting opportunity here out of the pound dollar and that's so that prediction again working out really well from last week giving us over a 100-pip drop out of the pound dollar with just this one red daily candle now after that the market pushed back up breaking above that major level of resistance and has since then pushed all the way up into our next major level of resistance or getting pretty close to that level at 1.425 this is the next area we're gonna be taking a look at here on the pound dollar for possible trading opportunities right here at 1.425 is a level we're gonna be looking at for possible short opportunities once again and other than that the market could turn around right here and push down if we get that push down then 1.409 to is definitely a place I'm gonna be taking a look at for long opportunities out of this market now below and above that you can take a look at the charts and see what we're looking at below that support levels looking around 1.3906 and our next level resistance around 1.44 even handle if we can get a break above these previous highs looking left here out of the pound dollar but that's what we're looking at coming into the future here on this pair the next pair and the final pair we're gonna look at today is the Aussie dollar here on this pair another good prediction from last week we expected this market to pull down into 0.76 after touching resistance at 0.7715 getting down into the 0.764 level then we expected after a touch of that level a nice bounce out of the market we said it could come all the way up to 0.777 which is exactly where the markets hovering around now so with that being the case what we're gonna be waiting for here on the Aussie dollar is to see if we can get some kind of entry reason on a lower time frame around this level that can give us a reason to go short on this pair now the reason we're looking at this level and expecting it to become possible resistance is because of these previous levels of structure this market used this level of support once twice and resistance once and now that we've pushed back up into that level we can't help but consider we can't help but think that the market could possibly use this level of resistance once again besides that or even if we get this push down the next trade we'll look for is a possible long trade off this previous resistance level that was broken on a lower time frame around 0.7715 it's a good place for us to look for some possible long opportunities out of this pair if we push above this resistance level then the next resistance level will be taking a look at 0.78 even for possible short trades here out of the Aussie dollar and again you can look and again you can see on the chart that we have other support levels pointed out at 0.764 where we found support last week out of this pair and another resistance level up here at this previous highest high looking at 0.7881 and that's what we're predicting coming up out of this Aussie dollar pair so again guys just want to reiterate that we're trying to provide value by helping you guys understand how to make predictions in the market predictions on the levels that are going to act as major support and resistance so I hope you found it to be valuable if you enjoy
