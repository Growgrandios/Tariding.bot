If you are just starting your trading career as a beginner or if you are not consistently profitable yet Then this video will be the most important video you see all year in this video I'm going to teach you everything you need to know in order to properly back test a trading strategy and before you write off back Testing like it's something that's unnecessary. Let me explain this to you right now I have almost a decade of trading under my belt and I would contribute 85% of the success I have to understanding how to properly back test without this skill and without knowing how to do this There is no way I would be sitting here talking to you today on this video And there's no way I'd be a professional trader and the reason for that is because the very first step to becoming a profitable trader Is having a strategy that gives you profits consistently over a large sample size? Notice I said large sample size not over every single day I'm not talking about having a strategy that makes you money by the end of every day as much as all of us wish that was the case It's normally not something that can be produced What we can produce though is an advantage over a large sample size to give us consistent profits over a long period of time Something like 100 trades There is no way to be a profitable trader without that and how do you determine whether or not a strategy can produce a profitable edge in the markets the process of doing that is called back testing That's exactly what you're gonna learn after the intro disclaimer We're gonna start off with what is back testing and then I'm gonna teach you a strategy that is proven over the last 100 trades To give an edge of a 60% winning percentage at a one-to-one risk reward After teaching you that strategy I'm gonna go through the process of back testing it with you and teach you how to back test properly throughout that process and Throughout the rest of the video to make sure that by the end of this video You have everything you need in order to know how to back test your own trading strategy and complete that first step to a profitable Trading career So if that sounds good make sure you're subscribed by clicking that button down below the video to the right hand side Make sure you click that like button for me to help out with the YouTube algorithm And if you want some extra content follow us over on Instagram at the trading channel And I'll be right back to teach you everything you need to know in order to back test a trading strategy You Welcome back traders, let's go ahead and get started with today's video and before we dive into what is back testing Let's take a look at what I call the triangle to trading success You see any trader that accomplishes each of these that masters each of these three skills inevitably will be a profitable trader There's no way around it, but without them. It's like having a car with no gas You could have a Lamborghini of a strategy But if you're missing risk management or you're missing discipline that car won't go anywhere That's like the gas for the Lamborghini You could have awesome risk management, but if you don't have a strategy that produces a consistent profitable edge over the markets You're not gonna go anywhere and you could have Extremely good discipline and you could discipline yourself right into an empty bank account if you have poor strategy That doesn't give an edge or a poor risk management plan So you need all three of these and what we're doing today is accomplishing the first one what I'm gonna do today And right after I get done telling you what back testing is is teach you a strategy that over the past 100 trades has produced a 60% winning percentage and at a one-to-one risk reward and That's been over the past 100 trades again because we're not looking at super small sample sizes We want to see what a strategy is produced over a long period of time so what is back testing back testing is nothing more than going through historic data and Looking for every situation that meets the rules of your strategy in case you didn't know this Strategy or your edge over the market is nothing more than rules that you have to abide by every time you place a trade You create this rule set using conditions Entries and stops and targets and then you go through historical data looking at every situation that meets those rules to Determine how that strategy performs over long periods of times over long periods of time for example on the pound Swiss Like I just told you I tested 100 instances where the market met every one of my rules And I did this 100 times per pair per time frame So I was on the pump pound Swiss one hour chart If I wanted to trade the same exact strategy on the four hour chart on the pound Swiss I would need to test 100 trades on the pound Swiss four hour chart if I wanted to trade the strategy on the euro Dollar then I would need to test 100 trades on the euro dollar on whatever time frame I wanted to trade it on so in back testing you want to make sure you have a large enough sample size to see multiple market Conditions and if your strategy that you're trading right now if you don't know what it's done over the past 100 trades That happened using that strategy you should not be trading it Because there is a high likelihood that it lost money over those past 100 trades And even if there's not a high likelihood it did that you won't be able to be disciplined to that strategy unless you've seen it Go through drawdowns during bad times multiple reasons to back test We won't get into that yet like I said back testing is the process of going through historical data and Testing the rules of your strategy every time they happen So for the rules of the pound Swiss strategy that we are going to take a look at the rules for this strategy consist of two very simple conditions the only two conditions that this market or this strategy is using is a cross of The 20 period exponential moving average Followed by a closed below candle for a bearish trade or a close above candle for a bullish trade That is the only conditions I will go through a couple of examples of these not back testing yet I'm gonna back test with you in just a second But just to give you a couple of examples here's a losing trade Why is it a losing trade and why did I place this trade in my back testing because we have a closed below the 20 period X-men to move an average followed by a closed below candle So all a closed below candle is to give you an idea of this entry reason is a candle that closes below the low of The previous candle as you can see close of this candle is right down here at the bottom of the body And we do in fact close below the low of the previous candle the wick of the previous candle for a bullish entry What do I need to see I need to see across above? The 20 period moving average as you can see we were below The 20 EMA right here. We then cross above the 20 EMA with this candle after crossing above this candle I need to see a candle that closes Above the high of the previous candle it needs to happen immediately After the close above or below of the 20 EMA for example This would not have been a trade reason being we have a close above our 20 EMA the orange line on the screen But we do not have a close above the high of this candle afterwards the close above the high of this candle needs to be immediately after the close above the orange 20 EMA and Let's go look at one more example and then I'll start teaching you a little more about back testing and a little less about the strategy I'll also share stops and targets with you So here again, we have a situation where this market Did we cross the 20 EMA did we close above it? Yes immediately after we got a close above This is the bullish version immediately after we got a close above the 20 EMA Did we then get a candle that closed? Higher than the high of the previous candle that answers yes to so in this specific case We have a valid entry after our entry. I used an ATR plus five stop loss ATR indicator have a full video on it. I'll put it to the top right hand side of the screen It's just an indicator that gives you the average of the last 14 candles that were printed on the chart to help out with volatility in the market When you're using a stop loss it keeps you from being whips all out because the market goes super volatile at once All right, so ATR plus five on that candle would be 17 plus 5 which is 22 And I'm using a 1.4 to 1 risk reward So we got 22 on our stop 1.4 up here and the stops and targets are as you can see this one actually hit targets Which is why you see the green line on my screen. So in this case That is the entire strategy. It's one of the most simple strategies I've ever tested and produced some really good results as you can see once I zoom out here on the chart your red lines Let me make sure you can actually see that the red lines are losses the green lines are winds as you can see going through a long Period of time blues or winds and orange or losses over here as well I just started trading it and testing it a little bit differently. I optimized the strategy which I'll do a video on next Which I'll do a video on next but right now just pay attention to red and green being winds and losses as you can see There's periods of time where we have Four losses in a row So as I said earlier, it's not like you're winning every single trade But if out of 100 trades I can win 60% of them and in this specific case on the one-hour chart This was from the beginning of 2020 to now. So let's call it six months. So in six months This produced again a 60% chance to win So all we do is get our 60 so track the 40 losses from the 60 wins We have 20 that means it with a 1% risk on your account over the last six months This would have produced a 20% gain on that account imagine if you were a little more a little more risk tolerant and One of the risk 2% per trade that means in the past six months on the pound Swiss one hour chart And of course you can't get every one of these trades. That's another important part of back testing We'll talk about in a second. I'm just showing you how profitable something as good as 60% accurate with a one-to-one risk Award can actually be we have 40% gain with a 2% risk on this one pair now What if you had five pairs you traded this with and they all produced similar results? Every six months 200% gain with a 2% risk It's insane how quickly things can grow when you start adding currency pairs to something this accurate So with this being the case that is going to be the strategy that we are going to test And we actually had a lot trade using this that I forgot to record which really sucks right here yesterday So yesterday we had cross below the 20 EMA followed by a closed below candle again closed below candle Just means candle that closes below the low of the previous candle. Hopefully now You have an idea of the strategy again stops are 1 ATR plus 5 in this case the ACR was right at 20 so I did a 25-pip stop loss and we had a 1.4 to 1 risk reward So now you have everything you need to know about this strategy for you to go and test it yourself Let's do a few examples. Let's actually test a few trades and I'll do it with you Also, I'll show you how you can record those trades again in back testing We're looking through historic data and we need to document every single time something happens I do that with green and red vertical lines on my screen The reason I do it with green and red vertical lines is because it makes it really easy when I'm plugging things into a spreadsheet To look right down here and go okay. This trade happened on the third of July in 2020 That makes it extremely simple for me to put into a spreadsheet and then I can mark it as a win or a loss after Recording the trades on my chart. I transfer them to a spreadsheet You can use a patent a pen but they need to be documented results because you are documenting these results in order to see if Over a long period of time this strategy has produced a profit and if it hasn't why would you trade it now? You want to make sure it's produced a profit over a long period of time that way you have a good idea to What you can expect in the future again? Nothing is set and stone. It's not like this means that every 100 trades. This is going to hit 60% But from my experience, it's pretty accurate once you've tested 100 trades on what the next 100 will do So that being the case let's go through and back test a little bit of this together So I can explain a little bit further about how to back test a trading strategy All right, let's go ahead and dive into back testing the strategy. What is the first step to back testing? Always going to be it will always be to have a set of rules or a Strategy that you can go through and test and these rules need to be as objective as possible For instance, I'll put the rules of this strategy on the screen somewhere. This strategy is extremely objective There's no way to get it wrong. We're waiting on let's call it a bullish version of the strategy The bullish version of this strategy is a green candle that closes above the 20 EMA Immediately followed by another green candle that closes above the high of that green candle that closed above the 20 EMA That's your entry that it's as easy and simple and objective as possible You don't want subjectivity in your trading as much as you can help it There's no way to completely get it out, but as much as you can help it So objective rules is what we need every time we're going to start back testing because we need to know what we're back testing And this process consists of taking those objective rules the strategy you just learned is what we're going to use in this case Going through a specific market. We're going to look at the pound Swiss And we're going to take a look right back here at the pound Swiss what I'm going to do is use market replay You don't have to do that. You don't have to use market replay You can 100% just look at your chart like this look at the far right edge of the screen and then Every time you see your specific strategy happen was this a trade Tell me actually see if you know the strategy already was this a trade that I would be taking Absolutely not. Let me explain why do we have a closed below the 20 EMA right here with this big red candle Yes, but does this red candle close below the low of the previous candle? It does not so would that be in the case this would not be a trading opportunity and this would be this would be a loss Why because we close above here and then we have the close above the previous high But before we start doing that like I said, that's how you would do it if you don't have a market replay tool I personally like to use market replay so we'll start right here and what I'm going to do is take all of this data I'm going to record it in a spreadsheet that I'm going to show you in just a second That's documenting the data and figuring out whether or not this is a profitable system We already have the rules right I've already taught them to you You know obviously in this case you already know what the back testing results are because I've already told you But just pretend we haven't looked at that yet and in this case what we're going to do is just go through historic data pointing out every time our rules our strategy Happened and then writing down in that spreadsheet was to win or loss and I'm going to document the time Date and currency fair that I'm trading as well that spreadsheet by the way looks like this This is my personal spreadsheet that I use for back testing as you can see what I like to look at is what pair my trading with time with date my stop loss and my target or targets if I'm trading to Positions you can create a spreadsheet like this or you can document your trades by hand I plan to create a page You can go to and actually download the spreadsheet or either if I can't get it to the point that you can download it from that page I'll get a page where you can opt in with your email address and I can send this to you directly So if you're interested in that leave me a comment below I'll work on that page if I get enough comments saying that you guys want the spreadsheet and that way y'all can have it for Free and if you're a part of the email address just understand that yes, sometimes whenever I come out with YouTube videos You'll probably get an email so that you can see it So that's not a bad thing and also you may get a couple of promotional offers a month of me saying Hey, we got some space open in our training programs But that's all other than that you get a free spreadsheet out of it So let's go ahead now and start the back testing process All we're going to do is move the chart forward and as we do we're going to record every time our rules are met With this specific strategy. This is the process of back testing Waiting on that push above the 20 EMA and close above we have it here. We had the push above here We had the close above here if we were to place this trade we would have a stop loss of 11 plus 5 Which would have been a 14 15 excuse me 16 excuse me 11 plus 5 is 16 would have been a 16 PIP stop loss we can tell right now without even looking we would have been Stopped out of this trade the very next candle. So what do we do? Well if we're gonna record that data We know that we're owned the pound Swiss We know that the time of this trade again, this is why when I'm back testing in reality always put a Horrors, I mean vertical line excuse me on the screen We know the time is six o'clock and it's on the third day of July in 2020 So I would just write all that down the time is six o'clock This is own seven three 2020 my stop loss in PIP is 16 And my target would have been a little bit higher than that at a 1.4 But I don't need my target in this specific case on my spreadsheet because I have a stop loss of 16 Which means that I lost negative 16 on that position. So that's exactly what it looks like when you're plugging it in We'll do nine more I'm gonna do ten trades with you guys and then what we can actually do is see the results of those trades And obviously ten is not a big enough sample size, but you would do this for 100 traits I'll speed this up a little bit with the play button here All right, we have a push below the 20 right here, correct Did this next candle close below the candle that closed below the 20 period moving average? No, this is a green candle. So obviously it did not close below this. So that's what we're looking for with the strategy Candle closes below the 20 EMA for a bearish version Then the next candle closes below the low of that candle this candle would have had to do something like this in order to be a valid entry And we will continue This candle would have been another situation where That we have a closed below the 20 EMA on this red candle, but nothing below that We have a close above right here, but nothing above that. That's the last time I'm gonna go over that You should at this point know what we're looking for At this point do we have a trading opportunity the answer that hopefully you said yes and the reason I hope you said yes Is because we have this red candle closing below the 20 period moving average does the next red candle close below the low of this red candle? Yes, it does as I said completely objective ruleset the close of this candle or the open of the next one The same exact price is the entry after the entry We use an ATR plus five. This is 15 So it'd be a 20 pips stop loss and we have a 1.4 to 1 risk reward Let's see if we hit targets here on this specific trade Nope, we're stopped out again. So if we're stopped out again for 20 pips what I need to do record that right? I need to make sure that I'm recording it every single time documenting the results of this specific strategy and Before I do that what should I've done first? I probably should have marked this with a vertical line to make it super simple So seven eight twenty on eight at eight o'clock seven eight twenty at eight o'clock. So this needs to be eight And it was owned seven eight 2020 I lost 20 pips so 20 and negative 20 now we can continue testing Throughout the rest of this data. So let's go ahead and click the play button and start again All right, if I delete this you can see that we actually have a trade here Why do we have a trade because we were below the 20 period moving after on this candle correct correct? We closed above the 20 period movement out of on this candle correct correct and after we close above the 20 period moving average Here do we get a close above candle the answer to that is also true. So with that being the case we would have a long position here This long position would have a stop loss of one ATR plus five which is 17 plus five Which is 22. I think this is the trade we looked at a little bit ago. So I know this one's gonna win ha ha 1.4 sorry if that was a creepy laugh 1.4. All right, let's see if we hit targets or get stopped out on this specific scenario Pushing down putting you through the real emotions of trading and then finally coming up to target So this would be a win of 31 pips with a stop off the 22 And we need to put our vertical line so that we can tell what the date and time is So let's go ahead and do that vertical line right on our entry candle now that we have that It'll make it really easy to go here And now the reason I do this and what you can see in the corner over here is the fact that I don't even have to change screens I can now see that this trade was on 7.8. 2020 at 1700 so I know it's the pound Swiss I should just be copying and pasting these but not pound Swiss at 1700 And pound Swiss at 1700 on 7.8 This was a 22 pips stop loss followed by 31 pip reward I do believe 31 yes, okay, so we have that trade recording Let's go ahead and continue pushing the chart forward and see if we get more trades And guys before we keep going let me explain a little more about the strategy the reason there's no trades in here In this area because it's just as important for you to understand when not to trade as it is for you to understand when to trade with a specific strategy We have a closed-below here. We don't get a closed-below candle immediately afterwards We have a close above right here on this green candle. There's not a close-above candle of that candle Immediately afterwards we have a closed-above candle here. No close-above immediately afterwards We have a closed-below candle. Whenever I say that I mean closing below and above the 20 EMA and whenever I say no closed below candle I mean, we don't have a candle that closes below the low of the candle that closed below the 20bma So in that case we have no trades up to this point point. Here is the next time we cross back above the 20 EMA. I need immediately following that a close above candle. If I don't get that, then I can't trade the next candle like this one. That wouldn't be an entry. It needs to be immediately following the first candle that closed above the 20 EMA on a bullish version of this strategy. We'll push the market forward, see if we get some more trades. Here we have a trade. As you can see, we have a market that pushed up and closed above our 20 EMA. Does the very next candle close above the high of that candle? Yes, it does. Perfect. So now we can put our position tool on. We can do our stop loss, which is going to be five pips plus the ATR of that current candle. 17 plus five is 22. Yet again, seems to be a popular stop loss, huh? So we're going to have about a 31 pip reward here at a 1.4 to 1 risk reward. Let's see if this wins. And the market pushes up eventually hitting that target. So what we do green vertical line on the entry candle showing me exactly the time and date that I need to record my spreadsheet, pull up my spreadsheet, make sure I can see that time and date. And now I'm ready to record. It's at 1900. And it's on 714. It was a 22 pip stop and a 31 pip reward. So there we go. We have all that recorded. I'll record pound Swiss when the video is over. I'm like writing that out. I feel like it's just going to cause us to waste a little bit too much time. Let's hit play. See what the market does. No entry here until let's look at this. We did not have an entry here because after this candle, we did not get a closed below candle. We didn't have an entry here because this isn't a close above candle. And this is not a close above candle. As you can see, there's no closed below or above candles directly after a candle that closes above or below the 20 EMA. And then we have this candle that the blue lines on now followed by a closed below candle. So what are we going to do? We're going to put a short position tool on or measure however you can, whatever your platform allows you to do. And our ATR on that candle is 15 means we have a 20 pip stop loss exactly and a 1.4 to one risk reward. We get play. We see that that is stopped out. So in this specific case, we have a loss of 20 pips on this trade. So what would I do? Red vertical line. We have a red vertical line right there. And that's on 716 at 1700. We pull up our spreadsheet. We have 1700. And we have that on 716 2020. This was a loss of 20 pips 20 minus 20. Alright, now we can continue. Go ahead and shrink this and hit play. And actually, I don't even have to hit play. I can move this out of the way. You can see that we've already ran into another entry candle. How do we do that? Well, we have first off this entry here where the market pushes back up closes above the 20 EMA and then has a close above candle directly afterwards. With that being the case, what would we do? Take our entry right here. We would have a stop of 180 R plus five is 17. That's 22. We would have a target at a 1.4 to one risk reward, which does get clipped right up here, as you can see. So with that being the case, this would be a winning trade. Let's go ahead and record this in the spreadsheet. First off, putting our green vertical line on our entry candle, which would have been right here. And now we can actually pull over the spreadsheet and plug in the numbers, which was at 12 o'clock. The trade was and it was on 716 2020. This was a win, which had a 22 pip stop and a 31 pip target. And guys, I've went through about five six of these now. I think you get the idea of how to back test. That's exactly how you would do it. I'm going to plug in the rest of the numbers. We're going to take a look at the results. I'll do that on my own dose. So you don't just have to sit here and watch me back test. Hopefully, now you have an understanding of the strategy and how to actually back test a strategy. Stay tuned though, because we're going to go through how you would optimize this strategy to trade it on the best currency pairs to only trade it in the best times that it works. For instance, you may notice that every trade you placed over the past 100 at 1 p.m. lost for whoever knows why. And if that's the case, you may not want to trade the strategy ever at 1 p.m. Right. So we're going to go over all that momentarily. Right now, let's jump into the spreadsheet after I get through testing the rest of these trades. I'll see you in a second. All right, trader. So here's the testing results throughout the past 10 trades using the exact strategy. I told you on the pound Swiss on the one hour chart. As you can see, we have everything recorded we need in order to optimize the strategy for trading it for the best times for instance, at 6 a.m. Like I said earlier, did it lose every trade at 6 a.m.? That's one thing you can optimize for. I also using this technique, having this stuff in a spreadsheet, you can test multiple different pairs, combine them and see how much better your results become in terms of a smaller drawdown or even a higher ROI return on investment. If you start to add different currency pairs to this, and you would do the same exact process of testing each of these, plugging them into a spreadsheet 100 trades, not 10 on every pair and every timeframe you're going to trade and then putting them all in a spreadsheet together to see what the max drawdown was over the past 100 trades. It's invaluable information to have in order to optimize your trading strategy and get the most out of it, which is what we all should want. Now, I can't dive as deep as I would like to with this in this specific video, but if you are ready for some more advanced training, we do offer the EAP training program and we actually have some spots available right now in that program. I'll put some testimonials on the screen from traders who have recently graduated from the program and in that program, you'll get a full training course, not only on back testing, but on the actual strategies I use on a day to day basis in the forex market, then a course on back testing, you'll get this spreadsheet and a full course on discipline and how you can be more disciplined to your trading plan that also comes with three to five email alerts each and every week, not to use a signals, but in case you want to see exactly what I'm seeing in the markets and to help you better understand the strategies that you're using in the EAP training program and that you're learning from that program. If this program, you also have what I call priority email, which means that anytime you have questions, it'll be me directly that you are talking to and I'll be answering any of those questions to the best of my ability in a timely manner. So if that's something you're interested in, the EAP training program is listed below. I hope this video taught you everything you need to know about how to back test is a very quick recap. What we have, the first step of back testing a trading strategy is to make sure you have a set of objective rules you can test through historical data. The next step is to go back through 100 trades, which the amount of time that it takes for you to get 100 trades depends on a ton of factors in your strategy. I have no idea how long you have to go back to get 100 trades. Start with going back a year. If you get less than 100 trades, go back further and I'm talking about on a one hour chart. On a four hour chart, I would go back three years. Test if you get less than 100 trades, go back even further and test again. The main mission here is just to make sure you get 100 trades. But the first step having those rules, second step, go back to the historical data and document each and every time it happened, when those rules took place. And at the end of 100 trades, see, did you have a positive expectancy? Did that specific strategy make money? For instance, with the last 10 trades on the pound Swiss, I know this is a large, not a large sample size and it's a small sample size, but out of the last 10 trades, we produced a very similar result to the last 100, a 60% winning percentage. And it ended up with a 60% winning percentage and trading with a 2% risk per trade, a 9.11% return with a three to 4% max drawdown. So that's very good results. And other than the ROI and the max drawdown, if I had a 60% winning percentage over 100 trades, that would be something I would definitely start demo trading personally and eventually put into my trading plan. So that's the second step, record the data and optimizing comes into play directly afterwards. When you start combining the testing results from one strategy from this strategy on from one pair to another. So get those testing results on multiple different pairs and then combine them all in one spreadsheet to see what your possible maximum drawdown is, what your estimated maximum drawdown will be, and to see what your total ROI should be after you trade this specific strategy for 100 trades on all the pairs that you're planning to trade with it. So I hope all of that made sense. If not, rewatch the video a couple of times back testing is simple of a subject as it sounds like, can get a little complicated, especially when we dive into optimizing, which I might do a full video on optimizing. If you'd like to see that, put a comment in the boxes below, just comment below. If you'd like to see a full video on optimizing a trading strategy, if that said, there'll be a video somewhere around my face that I think will also be really valuable to your trading. Make sure you're subscribed and click that like button if you enjoyed this video. Took me about three and a half, four and a half hours to make this.
