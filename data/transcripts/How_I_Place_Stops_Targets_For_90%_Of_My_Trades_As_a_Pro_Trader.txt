placing my stop loss above the double top by one times the ATR indicator. This indicator gives you the average of the last 14 candles. So all it really does is keeps you in line with the volatility of the current market. So with the volatility of the current market, our ATR is around 30 pips. So I would take my stop loss and go 30 pips above this high. So up to this high is about 42 pips. I'd need to go about 72 pips for this stop loss. Well, for taking targets, I'm looking down at the next level of support and I'm gonna ask myself, is it a major level? Has it been tested multiple times? After I do that, I know that this is gonna be an area where I look for targets. And especially if I get to this area and I see price go oversold. So now what I've done is created a full rules-based strategy using conditions and entry, a stop loss and a specific area for a target.
