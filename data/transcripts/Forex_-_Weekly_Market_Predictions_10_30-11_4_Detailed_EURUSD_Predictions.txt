We do a video like this each Monday that euro dollar analysis coming up right after the intro and disclaimer. So I'll see you guys on the other side. So let's go ahead and get this detailed analysis started here on the euro dollar. And what we're going to talk about is structure and trend and how we can actually predict what could happen next on a specific currency pair based around levels of structure. So here on the euro dollar chart you can see that we have a market that started creating new highs starting down here and new higher lows. New higher high, new higher low, new higher high, new higher low until we got to the 1.2060 area. That area proved to be an area the market could not get past. We pushed up, pushed back down, pushed up and then back down and once more back down. So after this top was formed the market actually pushed down breaking below support. Now this in fact is our first hint that the market could be changing direction previously we were in an uptrend and so this specific situation where the market starts to break support levels can hint that there's going to be a reversal in trend. So that's what was telling us that this market could possibly head lower and we actually had a trade based on these weekly market prediction videos right here from this area we called a little bit of profit last week right out of the 1.1872 zone. And what we just discussed about structure and trend is the reason we decided that that place would be a good point to actually look for a shorting opportunity. The market was in a condition that told us it could possibly reverse trend and then gave us an entry reason at a key point of structure. Now last week we talked about what we would be looking for out of this market if we actually did break below our 1.1686 zone. So I'm gonna play you guys a clip from last week's video talking about that. It'll be very short clip and then I'll be right back. But if this market breaks below that area then we have a long ways to go down all the way to the 1.1453 area for our next level of major support. And through this area is when we'll be looking for shorting opportunities on the way down. And if we get down to that 1.1453 that's where we'll look for another. All right guys so that's what we talked about last week on this pair. And as you can see we have now actually broke below that level. What we were talking about last week is waiting for some opportunities to go short on the euro dollar after breaking below this major level of structure support. So that's exactly what we're looking for for the remainder of the week. Now those opportunities can come either from this market pushing back up into the 1.1686 area then giving us a reason to go short by giving us some kind of entry reason or we could see this market continue down without giving us that much of a pullback and possibly putting in some simple patterns down here on lower time frames. But currently we're waiting on this market to get down to the 1.145 area and we will be looking for shorting opportunities on the euro dollar all the way down to that area. So that's some detailed analysis here on the euro dollar. Go ahead and change the color of this line to red and talk about all of our new levels of support and resistance for this pair. So as for resistance we just talked about it is the 1.1686 area that's the first level of resistance we'll be taking a look at to get a shorting opportunity out of this pair. If the market breaks above that level we'll be looking at the 1.1872 zone that'll be our next zone for a shorting opportunity. Now as for support we do need to draw in one more line here and the first level that I see is right in there for our next level support. The reason being because this is the level that acted as resistance multiple times in the past and could now act as support if the market gets down to that level. So for support we're looking at our first level being the 1.1453 level. If we take a shorting opportunity this is where the second targets for that trade will possibly be and if we get down all the way to this level we'll be looking for a counter trend long opportunity from that zone. Below that we're going to be looking at the 1.1299 level right around the 113 even handle four hour next counter trend long opportunity out of the euro dollar. So those are the things we're paying attention to here on this pair that's the detailed analysis I wanted to share with you guys to let you know exactly what we're looking forward throughout the rest of this week on this pair. Now we're going to head through the rest of the top five major pairs and talk about the key levels of structure and our plans on each of those pairs throughout the rest of this week. Our next pair today is going to be the Aussie dollar and here we are on that daily chart. Last week's analysis on this pair played out quite nicely so I'm going to play you guys a short clip of last week's analysis and what we expected out of this Aussie dollar pair and then I'll be right back to share this week's predictions on this pair. It's backed throughout the rest of this week on this pair. So currently this market right below the 0.7819 area if this market pulls back up and the body of that candle closes above that zone then we'll be looking at this level as support yet if we close below this level then we'll be looking at that level as resistance next it'll be the 0.7819 level as the first level of resistance if we get a close below that level and if the market pushes down from that level. Alright guys so as you can see here's that 0.7819 level the market did it up closing right below that level and we got that pullback on a smaller time frame right up into that level and the market pushed down very dramatically directly afterwards. So last week's analysis playing out to a T here on the Aussie dollar and now let's go ahead and talk about what we're expecting this week out of this pair. The first thing we need to do is change the color of these lines to resistance now the market is below them and they will act as resistance not support and another thing we need to do is point out another level of support for this Aussie dollar pair. I like to have at least two levels of support below price action and two levels of resistance above price action. So the first level that stands out to me is possible support is right there at the 0.7584 level. The reason for that is the amount of times this level is acted as support and resistance in the past. So we'll look to that as our lowest support level what we have currently is a market sitting around a support level at 0.7631. So for this week this market pulls back into that level once more and gives us a counter trend entry then we may look at that as a long opportunity and we could possibly see this market push up to the 0.7735 level. In that case we'll look for some trend continuation out of this market from that zone. If we get above that we'll be looking at the 0.7819 area as our next level of resistance and of course that lowest level support that we just pointed out is the 0.7584 level. So that's what we're looking at and paying attention to here on the Aussie dollar for the remainder of this week. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. The dollar in is another pair that we discussed in last week's weekly market predictions and this is another pair where the analysis from last week's market predictions played out pretty nicely. Last week we discussed this 114 even handle as a level of possible resistance that we'd be looking for shorting opportunities from. As you can see the market pulled into that area and it's currently pushed down well over 100 pips from that zone. So I'll play you guys a short clip from last week's analysis on this pair and then we'll come back to talk a little more about what we're expecting next out of the dollar in. All the way up to that 114 even handle and if you saw last week's video you'll know that that 114 even handle is actually an area of resistance that we were looking for to take a short position from if we get some kind of entry reason. So that's what we're going to be paying attention to here in the immediate future on the dollar in. Before this pair just as we were discussing a second ago we're sitting right at the 114 even handle. This is a place we'll be looking for shorting opportunities throughout the week. All right guys says you can see the market ran right into that 114 even handle and has currently pushed down right at 100 pips from that zone. Now what are we expecting next out of this dollar in pair? Well we can see this market come down into the 113 even handle right here where we had previous resistance and we'll be looking to see if we can get some kind of buying opportunity out of that level with an entry reason and other than that guys we're looking at our major levels and key levels of structure that will all still be the same as last week for this pair. So for resistance we have the 114 even handle once more. If we get up to that level we'll be looking for another shorting opportunity and also for resistance if we break up up that area we'll be looking at the 115 even handle for our next shorting opportunity on the dollar in. For support if the market continues to push down past this level of previous resistance then we can see this market get all the way down to the 111.79 area around the 112 even handle. That's the first place we'll look for a buying opportunity out of this pair and next after that is around the 110.73 area. So that's what we're looking for here on the dollar in in the future. Now we'll go ahead and move on to the next pair which is going to be the pound dollar. The pound dollar is going to be very similar to last week's video we're still in the consolidation area between the 1.323 and the 1.305 zone. Last week we talked about the 1.323 area as being an area of possible resistance we could look for a shorting opportunity from and the market did push down from that level although we did not get an entry reason out of this pair. So as for this week very similar to last week we're going to be looking at resistance around the 1.3237 area. The market pushes up to that area that's the level we'll be looking at for shorting opportunities if we get the correct entry reason. If we break above that we'll be looking at 1.3441 as our next level of possible resistance. Now if this market pushes down we'll be looking at support right here at these previous lows around the 1.3056 zone for a buying opportunity and if we break below that area we'll be looking around 1.2850 as our next buying opportunity on the pound dollar. Now we'll move on to our last pair for the video which is going to be the dollar Swiss. So here we're on that dollar Swiss pair and last week we talked about the 0.9873 area as being a possible level of resistance out of this pair. The market did come up to that level of resistance but unfortunately just did not cooperate with our analysis and pushed even higher. Also bringing above the next resistance level we had pointed out which was 0.996 and making it all the way to this 1 dollar even handled number. And right here at this even handled number we had a big sell off on the dollar Swiss. As you can see the market was pushed up and then sucked all the way back down with that pretty big candle wick there. So considering that I'm looking at this as resistance and I'm considering that this market could possibly fall all the way down to the 0.9873 area. Now because of this this area is now going to be turned to blue or support and what we currently have is if the market gets down to that level we'll be looking for buying opportunities out of this pair. If we break below it we'll be looking at 0.9740 as our next level of possible support. Now if we hit higher we can look around this 1.0 even handle and the 0.9961 zone this area can be an area where we look for possible shorting opportunities out of this market. And past that if we break above that level we'll be looking at 1.0089 as our next level of a possible trade to the downside.
