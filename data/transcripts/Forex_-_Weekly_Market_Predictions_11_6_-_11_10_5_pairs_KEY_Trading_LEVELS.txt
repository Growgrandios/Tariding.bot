Let's start this week's video out here on the euro dollar we're on the daily chart. This is a pair we did some detailed analysis for in last week's weekly market predictions video so before we go into what's going to happen next here on this pair it's a possible trading opportunity that we're looking for this week out of the euro dollar. First off I want to take you guys to a clip from last week's video where we did some analysis on this pair. So let's go ahead and take a look at that clip and I'll be right back. As you can see we have now actually broke below that level. What we were talking about last week is waiting for some opportunities to go short on the euro dollar after breaking below this major level of structure support. So that's exactly what we looking for for the remainder of the week. Now those opportunities can come either from this market pushing back up into the 1.1686 area then giving us a reason to go short by giving us some kind of entry reason or we can see this. So here we are back on the euro dollar now we're on the one hour time frame and as you can see this red line right here is actually that level of structure we were talking about the market possibly pulling back into and giving us an opportunity to go short. Well that's exactly what we got. We ended up with a nice opportunity based on a strategy that we teach in the EAP training program and what I'm going to do to be as transparent as possible is show you guys the email we sent out to all members on this trade and as you can see on 11.3 we sent out an email to all members of the EAP training program explaining that we were entering the market at 1.164 and we were going to be taking off our first target at 1.158. So let's head back over to the euro USD chart. As you can see here the entry at 1.168 the target at 1.158. So we ended up getting about a 60-pip trade based on the analysis we did in last week's weekly market predictions video. So using these structure levels to stay ahead of the market as you can see can really be beneficial and helpful to your personal trading. So if you want to learn more about the strategies and techniques we use in order to capture moves like this out of the market then you can click the link in the description labeled EAP to find out more about that program but otherwise we're just going to continue today's video. Head back out to the daily chart and take a look at what our predictions are for the euro dollar throughout the rest of this week. So now we still have a market in a downtrend we have still just broken below our previous level of support. We've pulled back, we got our entry out of that level of support that has now turned into resistance and the market has pushed down. If I had not been able to get involved in a trade then I would be looking for a move back up into the 1.168.6 zone for another opportunity to go short out of this pair. Now other than that we could see a push down if this market continues in the downward direction then we will continue to look for reasons to go short throughout that move down to the 1.1453 level of support and that's where we'll be looking for our first counter trend opportunities. If we break below that level we'll be looking at 1.1299 as our next level of support around that 1.13 even handle. Now if the opposite happens this market could push up and break above the 1.168.6 zone if that happens that level will then be turned into support. We'll be looking for long opportunities from that level then continuing higher. We'll be looking at 1.1872 as our first opportunity to short this market. Above that the 1.2060 level will be our next shorting opportunity right around these most recent highs. So that's what we're paying attention to here on the euro dollar and that's what we'll be looking out for throughout the rest of this week. Now we'll go ahead and go through the rest of this week's pairs continuing on first to the Aussie dollar. So here we are on that Aussie dollar pair and last week on this pair we talked about the market possibly pushing back down into the 0.7631 support level right in here. The market did push down to that level before pushing back up but we didn't really get any kind of entry reason from that zone and currently where the market's sitting right now there's really no potential for a trading opportunity to the up or the downside based on the strategies and techniques that I use personally in my own trading. So this pair is a great example of just sitting on your hands. There's not always going to be a trade and it's very important not to try to force a trade if the market is not in a condition that you see as potentially giving you an edge over the market. But what we'll put the Aussie dollar in a condition that gives us an edge over the market is if this market does push up and come back to the 0.7735 area that's an area where we'll be looking for a shorting opportunity based on the strategies we use and if the market pushes above that area the next level of resistance is 0.7819. The reason these resistance and support levels are important is because these are levels that the market tested multiple times in the past as resistance and support along with further back. So for support we're going to be looking right at where the market just pushed off of the 0.7631 area. If we get another pullback into that area in some kind of entry reason that we may take that as an opportunity to go along on this pair if we push below that the next level of support we'll be looking at is 0.7584 here on the Aussie dollar. So as for the immediate future not a lot here on the Aussie dollar but there's some of the things that need to happen in order for us to look at this pair and find a trading opportunity. Next up we're going to take a look at the dollar in so let's go ahead and head over to that chart zone. Now what are we expecting next out of this dollar in pair? Well we can see this market come down into the 113 even handle right here where we had previous resistance and we'll be looking to see if we can get some kind of buying opportunity out of that level with an entry reason and other than that guys. There was a clip from last week's video where we talked about this 113 even handle as being a major level of structure support because it used to be resistance and it was a possible place we could look for some long opportunities. As you can see as soon as the market hit that 113 even handle we were discussing in last week's video we had a nice push up of over 160 pips before the market started to drop yet again. So last week's analysis on this dollar in pair worked out perfectly and now we can see that there's some selling pressure right here at the 114.23 zone. Now this level is a very important level of resistance and considering that we have all of the selling pressure right there at that level that means as for the immediate future we're not looking for any type of long trade here on the dollar yen. What we'll be looking for if we take this market down to a smaller time frame we'll head down to the four hour chart we're going to consider this level as a possible reversal level what that means is we expect that this could possibly be a reversal in the overall trend on the higher time frame which is up. So with that being the case we're going to be waiting on this market to push down possibly below these support levels and pull back to give us some kind of reversal entry reason. So as for this week on the dollar yen we are only going to be looking for shorting opportunities on this pair. Now let's head out to the daily chart take a look at some other levels we'll be paying attention to throughout the week. So as you can see this market if it does decide to push down and reverse from this level has quite a long ways down to our 113 even handle yet again and also further than that we could see this market get all the way down to the 111.79 zone that'll be the first level support we look for out of the dollar yen and if we push below that level we'll be looking at the 110.73 as our second level of support as for resistance we could see this market actually push up and disagree with our analysis if that happens then we can look at the 114.23 as support if the market does get above that level and our next level of resistance is going to be the 115 even handle around 114.95 in that zone is where we'll be taking a look at for another shorting opportunity here on the dollar yen. So there's a look at what we're paying attention to here on the dollar yen we'll go ahead and move on to our next pair the pound dollar. So we're on the pound dollar chart you can see that we've had a really nice push off of the 1.3056 level of support. I'll push up a little over a hundred pips off of that level and this is actually the level we discussed in last week's video so let's take a look at a short clip from last week's weekly market predictions and now we write back to discuss what we're expecting this week out of the pound dollar. Now if this market pushes down we'll be looking at support right here at these previous lows around the 1.3056 zone for a buying opportunity and if we break below that. So on the pound dollar from that 1.3056 zone as I said before we got that nice push of a little over a hundred pips up to the level where the market is now so what are we expecting throughout this week here on this pair well we're still in this consolidation area with our resistance level being at 1.3239 and so what do you think our first and initial idea for the pound dollar is going to be this week. Well of course being in this consolidation zone we're going to be waiting for this market to test that level the 1.3239 levels the first level we'll look at for a possible short opportunity. Now if the market breaks above that level our next level of major resistance is 1.3441 and if we do break above that level this is an area we'll be looking for possible trend continuation trades up to that next resistance zone. Now if the market decides to drop down we'll be looking yet again for support around the 1.3056 level for a possible long opportunity if we break below that we'll be looking at the 1.2850 zone as our next possible zone for a long trade and again if we break below the 1.3056 level then we'll be looking for trend continuation down to the next level of support. So that is our analysis here on the pound dollar and what we're expecting out of this pair throughout the rest of the week we want to move on to our final pair which is going to be the dollar swiss. So here on the dollar swiss we have a close above our previous daily level of structure which is at the 0.9961 area because of this this level is now going to change into support and this is where we're going to be looking first for some possible trading opportunities. Now also because of this we have to find a new level of resistance for this pair so what we're looking for is a level that's been tested and respected multiple times by this market. The first level I see is right here the reason for that is because this level is acted as resistance multiple times in the past so that means it could possibly do the same if we get to that level once more. So as for our initial predictions on the dollar swiss waiting for this market to get all the way down and test the 0.9961 level give us a possible long opportunity for some trend continuation out of this pair if we break below that level we'll still be looking at the 0.98734 trend continuation long opportunity. Now if this market continues higher then we'll be looking at the 1.0089 level is our first level of resistance if we push above that level we'll be looking at 1.0167 as our next level of resistance and our next level for a shorting opportunity on the dollar swiss. Before we end the video today I want to give a shout out to John. John is a longtime member of the EAP training program who managed to bank in 300 pips using the strategies and techniques from the EAP training program last week. So shout out to you John great job in your trading last week and for those of you who are struggling in your trading and maybe you're at a point where you believe it's literally impossible to become profitable I would suggest getting some kind of trading education and it doesn't have to be the EAP training program from us here at the trading channel just any kind of education that can put you on the correct path because I see so many traders that learn the correct technical analysis that learn correct strategies that give them an edge over the market but that have an extremely difficult time staying disciplined to any of those strategies. So what happens is they end up trading a successful strategy during a period of drawdown and they lose a few trades and then they end up switching to a new strategy and this is a huge reason why a lot of traders do not find success in the financial markets. So John here is living proof that it is possible to have huge trading in financial markets and John's success last week his over 300 pip week was not all contributed to the EAP training program whatsoever. There is still a lot of effort that has to be put forth even after taking a training course you have to back test the strategy yourself you have to learn how to stay disciplined on your own and although seeing someone else stay disciplined to a trading plan makes it a little bit easier it's still an extremely difficult thing to do. So congratulations John on a great week of trading.
