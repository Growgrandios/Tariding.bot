Good trading psychology and a good trading mindset is not something you're just born with. It's not something that comes natural, but it's something that you can learn. And if you want to be a profitable trader, it's something you must learn. Every single profitable trader, including myself at some point, was losing money due to having bad trading psychology. And eventually, they made the realization that trading psychology as just as or more important than the strategy that you trade, they flipped the switch, got better at trading psychology, improved their trading mindset, and then became profitable traders.
