Hey guys, Stephen here from the trading channel. In today's video I'm going to be taking you through the charts and showing you some live trades that I'm already in and tell you a little bit about why I decided to get involved in those trades. The trade you see in front of you is a flag pattern breakout on the Euro Dollar. This is a trade that I sent to the subscribers to my website and this is something that I plan to do at least twice a month where I'll be sending a screenshot of a trade that I am either already in or plan to take and a detailed description of why I'm interested in that trade.

Alright guys so as I said before this is actually a trade that we shot out to the people subscribed to my email list and I just want to clarify that that is not a signal service at all. That is in no way an invitation to trade or a recommendation to trade in any way. It is strictly for educational purposes. I'm only showing you that to show you the detailed analysis that I go through before placing a trade and to help you become a more profitable and more disciplined trader. So let's take a look at the euro dollar here and I'll explain a little bit of why I was interested in taking this flag pattern breakout. First off of course we have this very large impulsive move obviously news based coming up and then this is what we refer to as our brief form of consolidation before the next impulse move or at least that's what we can expect after an initial impulse move like this one. Brief consolidation and through here until another impulse move is created. Now this doesn't always happen but according to my back testing results it happens more than it doesn't happen so as long as I give myself more than a one to one risk reward I can be profitable trading this way. So after I saw this flag here setting up on the hourly chart what I did was just went down to the 15 minute time frame to try to take a look and get a better view of the market from down here. Sometimes this will give you a much better look at what's going on than the hourly time frame will. So down on the 15 we can see that we did put in a nice flag here before the breakout and I actually waited until after this wick and close back above our top line. The reason for that is because I knew news was coming out so I did not want to buy this breakout right here right before the news came out. The news that did come out I thought would affect the market in a pretty big way and so I didn't want to get involved just before that news and just to be stopped out of this trade. So instead of being involved beforehand I just waited on this next candle. The wick came down and pressed back up showing me some buying pressure and we closed back above my trend line here. So that gave me the bounce I was looking for and allowed me to enter this trade. Now since then we've done nothing but consolidate sideways and I really don't like the way this trade is looking but according to my plan I cannot exit this trade until I'm either stopped out or take profit. So I'm going to stick with this one and we'll see what happens throughout the rest of the week. Hopefully we can get another impulsive move to the upside but there are no guarantees in forex trading. So let's take a look at some of the other live trades I'm in and then I'm going to go through the five pairs that I trade for my YouTube channel and show you guys what I'm looking at going into tomorrow and the rest of the week. So here on the dollar again we had a similar situation. Big impulsive move down. Before we started to create this really nice flag pattern here that we eventually broke out up to the downside and that gave us a good reason to short this market and look for targets down here at previous structure. As you can see I'm only selling half my position there and I do plan to hold on to the other half of the position because once we get impulse legs, if I just go up the chart here a little ways and show you an example of this, once we get these impulse legs a lot of time we get brief consolidation followed by another impulse leg, brief consolidation followed by another impulse leg if this is our brief consolidation then what we would love to see is another big impulsive leg move down. We have our target set up back at previous structure just in case that doesn't happen and we have our stops set right above our previous resistance in case the market decides to come back up. So we're protected either way but what we expect is the market to push down even further than it already is. Let's take a look at the Euro Aussie. Here on the Euro Aussie we had a higher time frame advanced pattern coming in right at a previous structure level. I'll give you guys a second to see if you can spot this one. It's going to be a bat pattern. Comes in from our X leg down here up to A, A to B, B to C and CD completion right around in here. We spotted this earlier today and took it. We actually got pretty close to being stopped out already but now the market has sort of reversed after bouncing off our previous structure level so maybe we'll get a push back up here to our 382 retracement and hit some targets but there's really no way to know on this one. If I just continue down the list here you'll see that we have a trade on the dollar Swiss. And here we are on the 4 hour chart guys I do want to point something out here as well. On the 4 hour chart when you start getting these really impulsive moves followed by just a couple of green candles here. Once you see a couple of green candles that's a pretty good time to start looking down on the hourly chart for some kind of breakout play. As you can see we get the impulsive move down a couple of green candles. The impulsive move down a couple of green candles. If you were to start looking for a trade on the hourly chart here you would see most likely a flag or triangle in both of these areas. Another impulsive move down. Looking for a couple of green candles back up and we'll go down to an hourly chart to see if we can find a flag pattern. That's what we would do if we weren't already involved in this trade at least. But that's part of the analysis I did in order to get involved in this trade is check my higher time frame trend to see that we were putting in really nice lower lows impulsive moves without much retracement at all which is a really good sign of a lot of bearish momentum in this market. So we took it down to an hourly time frame after checking that four hour trend. Here on the hourly time frame you can see exactly what I was talking about here. It's that area with just a couple of green candles on the four hour chart and here once more. What do these look like guys? They're going to be flag patterns coming down our impulsive move flag pattern brief period of consolidation before the next impulsive move down. And then again we get a brief period of consolidation before the impulsive move down. It's a really good way to start spotting these breakouts and also a good way to bring the higher time frames into your trading and use them to determine the trend of the market even as you go down to your lower time frames. So I've already pointed out while we're involved in this trade it's just a simple flag pattern after this impulsive move. We decided to sell this breakout with the expectation of the market going lower and if I zoom back out and even if I go back out to a four hour chart it might make it easier to see. We have now broke below this low here and if we can get below this one wick here then our next stopping point is all the way down here. So we could be looking at a pretty significant drop here on the dollar Swiss if this market can continue with the same amendment as now. And there are no guarantees but you always want to look on your higher time frame to make sure you're not at a stopping point once you sell the breakout. That'll increase your winning percentage on these breakout trades. So now we'll head down to the New Zealand dollar another live trade that I have owned and this trade is almost identical to the euro dollar trade except it's going a little bit more in our favor than the euro dollar. As you can see here hourly time frame we put in a nice impulsive move up brief period consolidation and then broke out of that period of consolidation and we've actually come up enough and put in a new swing low here that allowed me to move my stop loss which was down here. Now I've been able to move my stop loss up here and take away some of the risk on this trade. That's always a good feeling to be able to do that. Hopefully this market can push up a little further and hit our targets on this trade as well. So that's it for the live trades that I'm in tonight. Now I'll go ahead and go through the five pairs that I trade on my YouTube account and show you guys the things that I'm looking at going into tomorrow and the rest of the week. So we'll start here on the euro dollar and obviously I'm already in a trade here on the euro dollar hourly time frame so I did not plan to do anything until I either get stopped out or hit profit targets on this trade. But as you can see we are in a ranging market. There's a lot of consolidation in here and for those of you that trade advanced patterns you can really take advantage of this on a lower time frame. Once you start seeing this kind of consolidation you can jump down to a 15 minute from the hourly and you can see here where there are some really nice advanced patterns setting up. What I'm about to show you here is a technique called bracketing the market. If we look right here you'll see that we have a gartly pattern here on the 15 minute chart coming in from x to a a to b b to c cd completion down here at our 127. That one may have already been filled depending on whether or not you front run your orders. But also we have another gartly pattern setting up coming from this impulsive move here let's call that x down to a pull our extension from a to b back down in and here as you can see we're setting up for another gartly pattern this time bearish instead of bullish and we're actually getting pretty close to filling this one and for those of you that do not know the ratios of the gartly pattern then make sure to check out my video tutorial that is on my channel for the gartly pattern. I'll post a link for that in the bottom left hand side of your screen but also for those of you who already been to my website and signed up and subscribed you will notice here or hopefully you'll notice here that we are also putting in a butterfly pattern this butterfly pattern is going to come from x up to a a down to b b to c cd completion down there and if you haven't been on my website yet to subscribe there is a link in the description box below this video you can go there and subscribe and you'll get a free butterfly pattern tutorial plus like i was talking about in the beginning of the video you'll be getting free detailed analysis of of a trade that i'm either in or planned to take so make sure you do that before the end of this video but pull my extension here you'll see that our butterfly pattern ends right here on this one twenty seven so that's something good to remember once the one hour chart starts to consolidate you can always drop down to fifteen minute and normally find some pretty good advanced pattern trades moving along will jump down to the pound dollar here in here on the pound dollar one hour chart i really don't see much maybe a three eighty two retracement here for more swing low seeing that we do have a bit of structure looking left and we are at a three eighty two retracement i'll go ahead and drop down to a fifteen minute chart in this kind of situation and see if i can find any kind of reason for entry and i've already spotted one i'll give you a second to see if you can find it so we know previously on the one hour chart we've broken closed above our previous structure telling us that we should continue since that's the case now we can drop down to our fifteen minute time frame what do you notice here any kind of pattern formation that looks familiar we draw on some fibs here we have a bat pattern coming in from x to a a down to b be up to c and our delay completion to be down here at the eight eighty six and again i do have a bat pattern tutorial on my channel as well so if that's something you're not familiar with then i'll post a link in the left hand side of your screen you can click that link it'll open in a separate page and you can watch that video after you're done with this one but here on the pound dollar this is what we'll be looking for in order to get involved tomorrow or this will probably be filled or either invalid by the time we wake up but the great thing about patterns and the way i trade them is i can put on limit orders and i don't have to be awake for the completion of these patterns so that's what we're looking for here on the pound dollar going into this evening tomorrow and the rest of the week will drop down to the dollar yen again we're already involved in this trade take it out to the hourly chart what we're expecting here is just a continuation of this downward trend and we could possibly start putting in some consolidation here from the way this market looks we did create a couple of little higher highs here on the one-hour chart before dropping off but as i said overall we are still looking for this market to go lower if we begin to consolidate a little more than this then i'll start looking for advanced patterns here obviously once i either get stopped out or hit my targets on this particular trade jump down to the euro also that pattern is not treating us so well looks like this market has put in an impulsive move down little retracement and most likely will come down here to hit our stop loss and if we stay in consolidation here on the higher timeframe for our chart then i will just continue to look for advanced patterns and if we begin to break out of some of these levels if we do something like this then i'll be waiting for the brief period of consolidation and other impulse move brief period of consolidation and another impulsive move but as i said if we do continue to just consolidate in this range then that's going to be a good time for me to look for advanced patterns on the one-hour chart i was in Canada for our work out of ranging here as well we have recently broke these highs but as we often do in a ranging market we also came down here and broke those lows so really just ranging in this area good idea to go down to the hourly chart check for some advanced patterns we had a win on this today actually an advanced pattern that came in from x up to a a to b b to c cd completion right down here this was an advanced bat pattern this shot up to hit targets for us and now we are looking for any other kind of advanced pattern setup considering that we are in a period of consolidation and range so here as you can see we do have a six one eight retracement once we have a six one eight retracement what do we start to look for i know it's a bit early for this one but we are looking for this market to give us some kind of currently pattern here i changed the color of this one to read so you can tell it's a different pattern this is going to be a garlic pattern and if i bring on my fibonacci extension you'll see that the delay of this pattern if it does complete will come in at the one twenty seven and of course as i said we are a little far away from this one but i was trying to give you guys the things that i'm looking for going into the rest of week and this is one of those things now obviously just as with the other pairs if we continue to range i'll be looking for advanced patterns if we start to break out to the lower or the upper then i'll look for the brief period of consolidation the drop obviously seven eighty six retracement the drop brief period of consolidation and impulse and move down so if we start to trend i have a plan if we continue to consolidate i have a plan and as long as you are always in the driver's seat and you always have a plan no matter what the market decides to do you're setting yourself up to be a profitable trader alright guys so that's going to do
