What's up traders today? I'm gonna open up some clean charts and then I'm gonna throw 37 indicators on those charts so that we can crack the DaVinci code find the holy grail and master rocket science All of that was a joke today is actually about simplicity in our trading I'm gonna delete every indicator off of this screen and show you a simple approach using nothing but price action That can provide an accurate and consistent way of trading for you every single day This will overall lead to less losing trades and more winning trades also lead to no confusion at all about when you're supposed to play Straits in the first place so after the intro disclaimer We're gonna do that before the intro rolls if you'll do me a favor Click the subscribe button the notification bell just to be alerted about the new free content We come out with here on YouTube every single week Click the like button to help with the YouTube algorithm and follow us at the trading channel over on Instagram And I'll see you after the intro and disclaimer roll. See you in a second You We're starting today's video in the euro dollar and in today's video I'm gonna break down the top five major pairs using nothing but charts themselves no indicators necessary Just pure price and the way we do that is in two separate steps The first step is the directional bias of a specific pair. So in this case only euro dollar What is our directional bias as of right now on the daily chart if I was to be breaking this chart down It would be very obvious to me that this chart this specific currency pair is in a downtrend now How do we determine that? Being able to say that something's in a downtrend can be Subjective just saying downtrend an uptrend is very hard to determine when you look at a chart and you're new or you're not really Good at having rules for something like trending markets But the way we determine it is by creating rules. So our rules For a downtrend in this case would be lower lows and lower highs if we look at our previous highest high And then we drop lower here. You can see that the markets making Low here's our initial high our initial low a lower high Down to a lower low now these lower lows have to have a closed below candle past the low So this was our low we need a closed below candle once we get that we have our initial high to low and our pullback Once we get this closed below right here It's when I determined that we are in what I call a bearish trend We are in a downtrend essentially and I call this a one two three move So the initial analysis we do using no indicators at all to determine our Directional bias of a pair our trend is by looking for this rule What trend are we currently in right now in the euro dollar? We're in a downtrend and as you can see here That one two three was followed by another one two three move as long as we continue making lower highs lower highs and Lower lows then we are continuing again. Here's a lower low then we are continuing in this downtrend So with that being the case we have our directional bias now the power of this is that you can say at the point of Knowing my directional bias. That's the direction I trade on either lower timeframes or on this time frame You could do trades on a daily chart based on your daily chart direction now The second part of this is where's the market likely to stop? So if my direction is down, what do you think I'm looking for in terms of where the markets likely to stop? I'm gonna be looking for a support level that I think the market's going to stop at and for me that level is going to be right here so right now we have Determined that the euro dollar is in a downtrend and Likely to stop or possible to reverse back into an uptrend Who knows whether or not it's gonna happen? This isn't about knowing exactly what's going to happen This is about creating rules that you stick to to create a consistent plan and these rules do need to give you an advantage for me These do give me an advantage and the reason I know that it's one because I've traded this way for years too, because I've back tested this exact type of analysis through thousands of trades and historical data and I know that through Through history, which is all we have to go on as traders. No one can tell the future No one's actually psychic, but through history this has worked and since that's all I have to go on Then I really don't have a choice but to assume it's going to work in the future and although there's no guarantee of that again That's all we have to go on here as traders. So with that being the case According to my analysis our next stop stopping point for the euro dollar is going to be around 1.0 903 to 1.0877 that will be an area Because I do believe this is an area where the market could see a possible counter trend bounce after our first two steps right our Step number one markets in a downtrend so right now I know that my bias is down because of this downtrend But my bias only continues as down Until we get to a possible stopping point. So once the euro dollar gets into this level This zone I've pointed out as my possible stopping point. What do you think is going to happen to my bias? My directional bias is going to reverse I'm going to then assume that this market could have a possible push higher and if this market can have a possible push higher That means I'm going to be looking for long opportunities in this zone here on the euro dollar So we have completed the two-step process which is defining the directional bias you have on this currency pair Which is down right now. We're in a down bias until we get to this level. So right now in the euro dollar I wouldn't necessarily be looking for short trades Although we do have a downtrend this needs to be in your trading plan if you're going to trade the style based around structure and trend Based around price action and not based around indicators is that you look at levels of structure that are important Right here is an important level of structure on the euro dollar This is defined by this level being one of the lowest levels of support Looking left for a very long time if that's the case then it is an important level that has been respected by the market before and It's likely to be respected again. Now as the market approaches this level. It's what I'm going to stop with the short bias I'm no longer I no longer have the bias that this market's going to continue down because there's a possibility We had higher from this level so at this point I'm gonna be waiting for this market to get into this level before I look for long opportunities and as for trend continuation Always do two different Places that I'm looking for trades. I have my bias of a downtrend I'm looking for possible long trades in this area as for short trades an area I would look at for possible short trades if this market does start to head higher Either from this level that we're at right now Or if we dip a little lower and then go higher is the level around 1.1010 and 1.1 or excuse me 1.0 988 this level is where I'll be looking for trend continuation as traders at least for my style as a trader I am constantly looking for either a counter trend trade or a trend continuation trade And I'm honestly constantly looking for both depending on the levels the markets reaching or is at so this market being close to this level I'm prepared to buy the euro dollar if we make it into the zone and give it gives me an entry reason I'm not just buying because we're in this zone I'm also prepared for if this market entire this level here will be an area I will place possible short trades and trend continuation based on the total daily bias of the euro dollar That was a long winded way of explaining trend and explaining counter trend structure levels But I want to make sure that you understand the situation we're in here on the euro dollar We're in a situation where this pair is heading to a level of structure that's going to be important We may only see a slight bounce and no one psychic remember that the market may blow past this level But according to my analysis, this is a level that can provide support based on that analysis based on it giving me a Statistics advantage for instance Let me explain that in this way if it gives me a 65% chance that the market's gonna bounce from this level Do I need to be looking for long trades or short trades out of this level? Long trades, right? I have a statistic advantage now Does that mean that there's no chance of this market completely blowing past this level? No, there's still a 35% chance the market could just keep going down And if you've ever heard a weatherman say there's 35% chance of rain and gotten soaked because it's raining outside You didn't bring an umbrella then you'll know that there is a chance this market continues lower But it gives me a statistic advantage and that's what trading is all about is actually having that advantage. So here on the euro dollar These are my levels that I'm looking at for possible trades your next question should be well, Steven How do we get involved in those trades? So at this point we've talked about how to find really important zones of structure in the market using purely price action as a quick recap of that the things that we're looking for are trend continuation and counter trend zones in a trend continuation zone It's extremely simple for an uptrend. We're looking for this one two three move when we have a one two three move that breaks above the previous level of resistance The zone of structure at that previous level of resistance Can become support and that's what we're looking at as a major level of structure is this zone of previous resistance that was broken in the Opposite direction we're looking at a downtrend this would be the zone right here after our one two three move Here's our zone of possible resistance that we'd be looking for entries in because we're pointing this level out as an important level of structure because Essentially in trend these are the most important levels in the market now while the markets trending It's always going to be heading towards another level of structure unless that is the highest high that markets ever made no matter What financial instrument you're trading or the lowest low so knowing that information after looking at these train continuation zones We're also looking at counter trend zones. These counter trend zones are either going to be a level that sticks out like a sore thumb Like this one right here on the euro dollar this sticks out no matter how far you scroll this chart back This is the lowest low and I don't mean that as in you can't scroll back and see other shit I mean if you scroll the chart back a lot this sticks out like a sore thumb So that's one of the ways to find a counter trend level The other way is to find a level in the market that's been tested multiple times recently So we're looking for levels that have been tested two three four times very recently and we'll discuss that a little more later on in the video But now we have to break into that's not enough though, right? Let me let me start over that's not enough having zones that you Predict the market to go up and down from will not create a profitable trading strategy You have to have a way of actually entering the market in those zones Which is what we're going to discuss now, but understand this and before I keep going it is so important that you get this Watching one YouTube video Understanding the things the principles that I'm going to tell you here will increase your probability of being profitable will help you create a Positive expectancy in the market and possibly help you create a profitable trading plan But this is not enough just this one video just knowing these techniques Is it going to set you on a path of creating this long and prosperous profitable trading career? There's a lot more work to it than that and if you think this is complicated Waiting till we get into videos about breaking down how to create an actual trading plan right now You're just learning entry techniques and ways of spotting very accurate levels in the market to trade around okay? That's not enough. That's not a trading plan. That's the makings of a strategy But we still haven't discussed stops and targets and that's only a strategy It's only one piece of a very complicated puzzle that is trading so it's not rocket science It's not like trying to crack the Da Vinci code, but it's also not as easy as flipping on a light switch This is going to be a difficult thing to master and if you think it's too complicated for you then Trading just isn't for you. This is there's no way for you to master trading without putting in This work, so I will go ahead and give you the entry reasons some of the entries and I use in these zones But I don't want you to take this and go start trading it with a lot of money right now because that is irresponsible to yourself and your bank account And your trading account you need a proven to be profitable trading plan Fully tested with a risk management plan and something you know you can stay disciplined to before you start trading And that's not something I'm even capable of giving you in a 20-minute YouTube video. Nobody is This is something you'll have to work on a ridiculous amount And I'm gonna talk more about that in other videos and we do talk about that in any of the training courses that I offer But this is not going to be all you need although it will help Tremendously let's break into how to actually enter a market in zones like this over the past couple of weeks I've talked about two different strategies one of them one of the favorites at least crowd favorite I'll say from everyone that's responded to the video is the five-week rejection strategy does a brief recap of that strategy It is super simple. We are looking for an area in The market that's been tested multiple times or one of our important areas We just discussed right and we're looking for this area to have been tested and rejected by five weeks a good example Of just these five weeks is right here on the euro dollar right here on the euro dollar You can see that we have a week here. This is one two three four Five and if I put a straight line at the highest body of those five weeks We can see that we have five different weeks that test that line That's a five-week rejection of this area and with that being the case the entry of a strategy Like this would be the close of that fifth candle that fifth candle after the week rejection the close of that candle would be the entry Stop would be above the Swing high whatever the swing high was in that case and targets could be whatever I'm not I'm not sharing an entire strategy in this video Just teaching some pure price action techniques But there is a full video on this strategy I'll put a card in the top right hand corner and a link in the description to that video That is one way I look to enter trades in these markets. I get questions almost every time I do videos like this Steven, how do I enter markets in that case? That would be a way that you could test Entering the market like that again You have to go through and do back testing yourself And if you're not clear on what back testing is I have links in the description and I'll put a link in the top right hand corner For a video I did explaining back testing as well But you have to go through and back test these on your own doe go on and just start trading these That's one of the biggest mistakes traders make is trading too soon So that's one entry that I like to use the other one is called a double top double bottom And same color kicker and let me explain what that means. It's very very simple if I'm looking for a double bottom I want to see a double bottom that happens and then a green candle That's the same color kicker if I see a double top I want to see a double top that happens and a red candle at the end of that double top that doesn't close below the highs of the first Test that's an extremely simple way of getting a little bit more confirmation out of double tops and bottoms So in this particular case, I know this has been long-winded But I need you to understand all of this before moving forward in your trading career So that you have the best chances of actually creating success and trading Combining all of this would be you would take look at your charts find your directional bias find your stopping point or counter trend trading zone and In these zones if you were to create a full trading plan around this that you test Do not do not go out and start trading this you have to test it yourself You would look in this zone for a double bottom green color candle kicker Exactly what we just discussed or a five-way projection strategy. You would create rules for your stops and your targets in this case on these types of traits and then you would actually have a full Strategy after you have that full strategy you have to take back test it in historical data See that it provides an edge over the market on the specific currency that you're gonna trade it on and You can go from there in terms of creating a risk management plan and a full trading plan around that type of strategy But we would be looking in this area for a five-week rejection or that double bottom green kicker If we see the market at higher we would be looking in this area for what what do you think we would be looking in this area for? If we were looking for short-trades It would be a double top red kicker right or a five-week rejection to the high side So we'd want to see five different candle wigs Rejected by this level the close of that fifth candle would be the entry stops above here targets wherever you'd like to put targets Again, the full strategy for both of those is linked in the description where you can learn the full actual Rules for those two strategies including entry stops and targets But again, that's still not enough Trading is difficult you are going to have to take and test all this in historical data on your own to gain the confidence You need in order to stay disciplined to these strategies and to create a risk management plan that fits with your risk tolerance So this has been a little bit about how to trade pure price action with entries included So that's how you would enter the market in these types of areas now what I'm going to do is go ahead and break down the other Currency pairs that we're going to look at today. We may look at a couple of pairs I'm thinking just the dollar yen here and the Aussie dollar right here on the dollar yen I've already marked this up to save on time because this video I knew was going to be a bit long with everything I wanted to explain in it This market's in a period of consolidation if you'll remember our one two three move to either side is what tells us if we're in In this market we have a low to a high to a higher low But if you know what I'm saying with one two three we have one two three hasn't happened We haven't broken closed above this level yet. So What I'm going to do is prepare for that situation by saying if we do get a close below this Excuse me a close above this level then this level here will become my trend Continuation zone and I've already pointed out a counter trend zone looking left So if I scroll the chart back this is my next Counter trend zone on the dollar yen if we get this break above and continue in this uptrend on this pair With that being the case let's explain a little bit about what we would be looking for with this scenario playing out We get a close above here. We create our three in this one two three move Excuse me one two three this would be one then we get a close above here We would be looking for the pullback to come into our train continuation zone We would be looking for a double bottom green candle or a five-wheel projection out of that zone the purpose of this Has been to explain to you how to use pure price action to create rules that can give you an advantage over the market Now you have no way of knowing other than me telling you whether or not this gives you an advantage over the market and you should not Trust any trading guru from YouTube. I'm not calling myself a guru. This is a strategy I've tested but you shouldn't sit there and trust your bank account and your trading account to the information you've seen in this video That would be irresponsible of you You should take this and go do the work test it for yourself in historical data See that it provides an edge over the market and then decide whether or not you want to create a full trading plan around it And actually create a profitable trading career So I hope you do that and if you want some more advanced training other than what I just showed you Then we do have a program that'll teach you that entire process in a step-by-step way to help speed up your process of becoming a profitable trader and Starting your path to a profitable trading career that program is the mentorship program.
