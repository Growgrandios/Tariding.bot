Otherwise keep it locked here through the intro and disclaimer and I'll be right back to start structure based trading episode seven. Welcome back traders so we're going to start off this week's video as normal with the euro dollar and what we're going to do is go through all five of the most popular pairs in forex pretty quickly today and we'll also be taking a look at a few short clips from last week's structure based trading video to see how that analysis panned out. So as you can see here on the euro dollar my blue line indicates support in this market throughout last week did push down into that blue line or that support level that was my area to look for potential trade opportunities we pointed out in last week's video structure based trading episode six. So what I'm going to do is pay a very short clip of last week's video pointing out that area and then we're going to come back and see what actually happened on lower time frames and to see if this market gave us a reason for entry at this level. So I'll go ahead and play that short clip now and I'll be right back and for support because we still could see this market push down from this level and then back up and for support we're looking at 1.112 that zone and as I said if this market does. Alright guys so from that previous structure based trading video that we just saw a clip of you could see that we were actually looking for support for this market around the 1.112 area which is what we pushed into and now what we're going to do is jump down to some smaller time frames some trading time frames which is what we do here in these structure based trading videos and and is also the way I do my analysis I start out on a higher time frame like a daily chart looking at these major levels of structure which I define as a level of structure in the market that's been touched more than two times then I drop down to smaller time frames like the four hour and one hour charts in order to look for possible entry reasons so let's go ahead and jump down to a four hour chart and take a look starting off here at the four hour chart I really can't see anything that would have caused us to want to get involved in this trade we did push down to our level that was also a level on a four hour chart previously but once we got down here we really just pushed straight up so really no way to get involved on this specific time frame but something I would have considered a trading possibility is actually down on a one hour time frame and I'll show you guys that now and this is something that I like to use in my trading after bouncing off one of these higher time frame structure levels and that is any kind of simple patterns so coming from these higher time frame structure levels like where our blue line is now the 1.112 level that we looked at last week after pushing up I like to see a market on this one hour time frame that can at least break the previous level of structure resistance if we're looking for a bullish move and after breaking that level putting in some kind of period of consolidation now this to me presents a good opportunity to hop on board what could be the beginning of a new trend because we are bouncing off a previous daily level of structure that's been tested multiple times so we know that that is possibly a level that can really push the market in whichever direction right if it's supported it'll push the market up if it's resistance it may push the market down so since we know we have a little bit of edge by coming off this daily level of support and then we're not just waiting on one simple candlestick pattern we're waiting on the market to show us an impulsive move up that breaks a previous level of structure on our lower time frame along with a period of consolidation to break out of so this period of consolidation would be where the buyers from this impulsive move up may be taking some profit and people that have had a short bias on this specific pair decided that this was a good position to sell the market and that caused this little push down and oftentimes caused these periods of consolidation that we consider as flags triangles and penance and then the breakout shows that the bulls would like to take back over shows that this market could potentially continue higher so that's one way we like to look for potential trading opportunities after touching one of these higher time frame levels of support and resistance and if you guys would like to learn more about some of the strategies i use similar to this then i'll leave a link in the description below the video and also a link in the card in the top right hand corner of the video to our subscription base program the eap and that program comes with a full training course on strategies that i use in the market every day but if you're interested in learning more go ahead and click the link or click the card in the top right hand corner of the screen and we're going to get back to the analysis here on the euro dollar so now that we've taken a look at what happened based on last week's structure based trading let's consider what could happen later this week and also into next week so what i'm going to do is zoom back out to my daily chart and we're going to take a look at these levels see which ones still hold up as resistance and support and also point out our new levels if we have any so we have pushed down from the blue level here which means this level is no longer blue it is now red for resistance and since we have pushed down we actually need to find another level of support because during this process i'd like to point out at least two levels of support in which the market can push up from and two or more levels of resistance in which the market can push down from so now we have our levels of resistance that we'll be looking for those levels consist of 1.127 here on the euro dollar so if the market pushes up all the way to 1.127 then i'll be looking for potential trading opportunities from that level if we decide to go higher my next level of resistance is 1.134 due to the fact that that level has been touched and reacted from multiple times in the past as you can see from these black circles i'm drawing now so that makes me interested in training opportunity from that level now for support we may see this market push down from the level it's at now and if we do then we will not only be looking for support at this blue line once again as a retest of our previous structure but if we look back and look left we can see that there's also a potential structure level right here that the market could come down into and this level could act as support for this market so we'll change color of this line to blue and if the market does decide to push down through our previous level of support the next level we'll be looking at to support this market is the 1.097 area so that's what we'll be looking for here throughout the rest of this week and into next week on the euro dollar so now we'll go ahead and move on to the next pair all right guys so here we are on the dollar yin our next pair we're going to be taking a look at and this pair gave us a trading opportunity last week by doing something like this i'll zoom in a little closer here on the chart and show you guys how we push down below this previous level here and then the market pushed back up into that level and actually gave us a shorting opportunity last week i did manage to record that trade and i'll put a link to that video in the top right hand corner of your screen along with in the description below it will be labeled dollar yin trade but instead of going down to lower time french and discussing that since it isn't a video i've done previously what i'm going to do is go ahead and point out the levels here on the dollar yin that we'll be paying attention to here at the trading channel for the remainder of this week and on into next week since we have broke above this red line we've actually pushed back above that level now we'll be looking at this as an opportunity to buy the market or as a support level for the dollar yin currently we're getting pretty close to our 111.99 area in which we'll be looking for a shorting opportunity in this area if we get the right kind of entry down on a lower time frame then we'll possibly take advantage of that as a shorting opportunity here on the dollar yin and if this market continues up let's say that we push up above this area pull back into it and go up even further the next level of resistance that we'll be looking at is 114.28 based on our higher time frame structure analysis and below where the market is now we're looking at support levels if the market decides to push down from this resistance level somewhere around the 110.59 area and if we go further than that down then we'll be looking at the 108.34 level for support here on the dollar yin so those are our levels that we're paying attention to here at the trading channel for potential trading opportunities throughout the rest of this week and next week what i'm going to do is go ahead in the video here and this is going to be structure based trading episode seven part one and what i'll do
