Hey guys, Stephen here from the trading channel. I hope you're doing well in trading green. Today's video is going to be a review video of my trading using the strategies that I teach for free here on my YouTube channel. And if you're new, I normally do a video like this about once a week where I go through the markets and show you how the strategies that I teach here on YouTube have performed since my last video. So make sure you subscribe to stay informed about how these strategies are performing in the markets. And it has been a while since I came out with a review video, so this one is going to be a bit longer than normal. The reason for that is because I've been working on my website.

So go ahead and click the link in the description box and it will open a new window. While the intro and disclaimer roll, and you can subscribe to the website for that free butterfly pattern tutorial. And I'll be right back to share with you guys how the strategies have performed since my last video. Alright guys, so just an update on my trading and the strategies that I'm using. I now only trade with five pairs. Instead of the nine that we started with, now I'm only going to be trading five different pairs using these strategies because it's just a lot easier to keep up with considering all that's going on. So now I'm going to be trading the euro dollar, dollar yen, pound dollar, euro, Aussie and Aussie CAD. Those are the only five pairs that I'm trading using these strategies that I teach here on my YouTube channel. I've posted links in the corners of the screen to all three of these strategies. The simple pattern strategy that I use, the advanced patterns that I use, and also the 786 strategy that I have here on my YouTube channels. So if you are in search of a strategy or just need a creative spark to start making your own strategies, then make sure to check those out and see if you can get some ideas from them. But with that said, let's go ahead and go down to the charts here on the euro dollar one hour chart. As you know, if you have seen a few of my other review videos, I only trade on the one hour chart when trading these strategies. And I've went ahead and took the liberty to point out all the trades that I took here on the euro dollar on the hourly chart since our last review video, which was on 4.11 April. So it has been almost two months since my last review video, but that will give you a good opportunity to see these strategies perform a very longer time period than just a week. So let's go ahead and take a look here at the euro dollar. And I'll talk you through some of the analysis that I went through in order to get involved in these trades. You see here that we had a 786 trade, and this trade lost 38 pips. And let's talk about why we were involved in this trade. Well, as you can see, we were in a downtrend and then all of a sudden the market starts to make higher lows here and higher highs than the previous high here. And this is telling us that there's a possible reversal in the works. So once I get a couple of higher lows and a couple of higher highs, as you can see, you can count on higher low number one, higher low number two, higher high number one, higher high number two. Now I'm looking for a 786 retracement in order to get involved in what should become an uptrend or what I would expect to be a reversal. And as you can see, you're not always right. Sometimes you expect a reversal and the market presses down instead of reversing here. And that's exactly what happened to us here, and that's the reason we lost 38 pips here on this trade. We pulled our 786 retracement from the swing low here up to our swing high. And as you can see, if I go ahead and pull this on here, 786 came in right here with our stop loss placed just under this swing low. And our profit targets up here. As you can see, we did set ourselves up with a pretty good risk reward, but we barely got wicked out by these little candles here. And that'll happen to you sometimes. Don't get too frustrated, just trade your plan. Let's go ahead and go down the charts again. So as you can see, we did come down and break below not only one, but two swing lows here. And considering the market has enough bearish momentum to break through two different swing lows, then I know which direction I want to be trading this market. And that direction is down. And the way I like to get involved in a directional move is by taking a 786 retracement here. Target's back at previous structure. Stops just above our swing high. And as you can see, we did win about 74 pips on that trade. Continuing here, another loss of 40 on a 786 strategy. Pretty obvious we were breaking into new lows. As you can see here, and we expected the market to come up, get close to our 786 retracement and continue in the downward direction of the underlying trend. But that did not happen. Instead, the market reversed there and started going up, creating a little bit of bullish momentum and stopping us out for minus 40 on this trade. Next up, we break above, again, similar to last time, one swing high here. We break above another swing high. Once that happens, I decide to take a 786 retracement from our previous swing low up to our new swing high, buying the 786 right here, and riding it up to previous structure in order to hit targets of 43 pips. We just continue along the chart here. You'll see that we had a simple pattern trade here. The market is an extremely bullish trend, as you can see, and we put in a nice ascending triangle here. We bought this breakout with this candle here. And rode that up to about here for around 50 pips. We didn't catch the move all the way to the top, and that's something important to remember too, especially when you're trading these breakout trades. Set yourself up with a pretty good risk reward and test it to make sure it's profitable, but don't always worry about trying to get at the very top, because that's going to be about impossible every time. Instead, just back test a strategy, giving yourself a 1.5 to 1, or a 2 to 1 risk reward, whatever you're comfortable with, and then trade that way every single time. Trade with two different positions. That would be one way to capture a little bit more of the move. But moving on, we did manage to capture 50 pips on that trade. Let's see if we have any more. Oh, yes, another simple pattern trade. As you can see here, market pressing down pretty strongly, and then putting in this nice looking little flag pattern here, before breaking out to the downside, and banking in around 45 pips in profit for us. Now, this was just with one target. I don't trade multiple targets here for my YouTube account. If I did, this would have been a lot more than 45 pips, as you can see. But if we just continue here, you'll see that we had a successful 786 trade, pulling from this swing high down to this swing low, not quite being stopped out. Our stop loss was about 20 pips above this previous swing high here. And because of that, we were not stopped out of the trade, and instead, we made 38 pips on that trade. And then another 786 trade. As you can see, we've continued to break structure to the downside here, breaking below our previous swing low. Obviously, once we do that, if you've seen any of my previous videos, you're probably starting to get the idea now just from watching this one. Once we have that, I start to look for a 786 retracement. We got that right here. And I rode it all the way down to our previous structure level here, taking in a target of 74 pips. And here goes the fun stuff, the advanced patterns. Nice looking, garly pattern right here that came in right after our 786 strategy win. And the way I handled this situation, because what you could be thinking right now is, well, why didn't you take this as a 786 pattern, because you broke it up. Because you broke structure to the downside. Yes, we did, but any time I have the opportunity to take advantage of an advanced pattern, I always choose the advanced pattern over the 786 strategy. As you can see, profit of 36 pips off of that move there. And here we are at present day. So that's how the EuroUSD performed. So now we'll head to the dollar yen. Here on the dollar yen, we actually had a rough couple of months. I think we only banked in about 30 pips in two months off this pair. But I'm not complaining about that, because that is still in the positive direction. As you can see here, put in a nice bat pattern that was stopped out. And then, directly after that, pretty rough April for the dollar yen. And right after that, minus 38 on the 786 trade that you see here, pulling from our swing low to swing high after the break of this resistance level. Now we've come down, and since we broke through one, two, three different support levels, I expected the market to continue in the downward direction. And because of that prediction, I lost 60 pips on a 786 pattern from here down to our swing low. And we'll continue on up. As you can see here, put in a nice flag pattern that we were able to profit from for about 55 pips. After this very large impulsive move up, started looking for a brief area of correction or consolidation, which we got right here in the breakout there. Did not quite get stopped out before moving up and hitting our targets. Big move down, but no simple pattern here. No simple pattern until right in here where we get this nice triangle and break out of it to the downside for a positive 78 pips. And then expecting the continuation of this down trend, we did try our hand at a 786 pattern from here. Going from our swing high to our swing low, entering right here and being blown out of the water stopped out on that trade very quickly. Next up, large impulsive move up. What do we look for after these large impulsive moves? Simple patterns. And here is our triangle that we broke out of and managed to make 60 pips off of. Next up, what have we done? We have broken through resistance levels. Created a higher low, a higher high, then our previous resistance level. And so we pull a 786 retracement from the swing low up to our swing high. And we came down, as you can see, touched our 786, tested previous support, and pushed up, eventually hitting our targets up here at our previous highs. Continuing across the chart here, minus 37 here after the break of resistance. And no continuation of this upward trend like we were expecting. Instead, we pressed down and broke through support. Then we were looking at this Gartley pattern here. Which came in as the market started to consolidate. And as you can see, blown out of the water and stopped out on that trade as well. Minus 60 here after the impulsive move up and flag pattern breakout that did not quite go our way. And then plus 60 here, canceling out our previous trade. After the market came down impulsively and put in this nice little triangle here that we eventually broke out of. And that's present day here on the dollar yen. And we'll head down to the pound dollar, only a few more here. Pound dollar was pretty active over the last couple of months with advanced patterns, 786 trades, and simple patterns. As you can see here, we lost on a 786 trade. And you can probably take a guess on why we were trading this. Nice break of resistance here. So we expected the market to. After breaking this resistance, come down, get close to a 786 retracement, continue up. That did not quite happen. Instead, we came down and pressed down even lower, stopping us out for minus 45 pips. Then we ran into this Gartley pattern, which also stopped us out for minus 27. Next up, we ran into a nice Gartley pattern for a positive 60. And then a nice 786 pattern. Again, you can see that we broke structure to the upside with this here. And if we are also with the underlying trend, which is up, pulling from swing low up to swing high, making a 786 retracement right here. And eventually coming up, pressing up and hitting targets for almost 100 pips. And then we have this nice impulsive move up here. Followed by a triangle pattern that broke out to the upside and gave us a positive 88 pips. Now the reason this 88 pips is circled is because this is a trade I could not take advantage of because of the time of day. So this is something you have to pay attention to while you're back testing, especially if you're back testing something that you're not trading with limit orders. If you're back testing something, you're going to have to trade with market orders and you have to make sure that you're awake for all the trades throughout your back testing. Here was an example of a trade that I was not awake for so that 88 pips was not made. And I'm actually going to put an X on that. And next up, as you can see, we've now broken through resistance here. So what do we do? We pull from our swing low up to our swing high. We hit this 786 retracement right here and move on up to targets for 133 pips gain. And then of course we try it here with not quite as much luck pulling from our swing low down here up to our swing high and losing about 45 pips on that trade. Moving along, again, breaking through previous support here. Because of that, we're taking a retracement from swing high down to swing low. Looking for this 786 right here for a positive 121 pips trade. Again, we try the same thing after this break of support right here. Oops. Right in here. Try in the 786 strategy again and losing 62 pips on that trade. Here was a very big loss of 120 pips trying the simple pattern flag pattern here after a big impulsive move to the upside, looking for this correction, and then a breakout back to the upside. And we got a small breakout to the upside, but not quite what I was looking for missing my targets and eventually coming down to stop me out for 120 pips loss. Here we had a 786 pattern that felt, and you can see why I was involved in this. Breaking below this structure level, breaking below this structure level, lower highs here, and pulling down to our swing low to be stopped out for 44 pips on the 786 pattern. And now a successful 786 pattern after the break of the resistance level, pulling from swing low to swing high, catching the 786 right here, not being stopped at the upside, but not being stopped at the upside. Now we've just stopped out by these candles and eventually pressing up to hit targets at previous highs. As you can see, the market came down, putting in a nice impulsive move, and what do we look for after impulsive moves like this, simple patterns, like this flag here, waiting for the breakout and then selling the breakout in order to profit about 59 pips from that trade. And most recently we lost 45 pips trying a 786 pattern on the pound dollar. Next up, instead of going over the next two pairs, I'm just going to head over to the spreadsheet because this video is getting a little bit too long and show you guys how the strategies have performed since the last time I came out with a review video. Alright guys, so before we start looking at this equity curve, I'm going to go ahead and bring up my notepad where I've written the pips that we made and lost on all of these pairs since April since my last year. Since April since my last video, since April, we've made 282 pips here on the euro dollar, 31 pips on the dollar yen, not so good for the dollar yen, 289 on the pound dollar is pretty good. Loss of 23, so the euro Aussie performed pretty badly, and a win of 139 pips in the last two months on the Aussie CAD, totaling 718 pips over the last two months. Now some of you may think that's a low number, some of you may think that's a high number, but for me I'm completely satisfied with the number of pips we've been able to accumulate over the past couple of months. It puts me right on track to where I want to be by the end of the year. And this is more so the reality of a profitable trader. It's not necessarily all these huge weeks and huge months where you make a thousand pips in a week or a thousand pips in a month. More often than not, it's going to be like this. You're going to be making a lot of money on one pair during the course of one month and a very small amount of money or even a loss on other pairs during that month. But if you have your portfolio set up correctly, then your winning pairs should outweigh your losing pairs. And throughout the course of a longer period of time, like a month or two, you should come out profitable. As long as you have back tested a plan that you have found to be profitable and you are capable of trading that plan exactly as you've tested it. That is the only secret you need to know about trading guys. So now that we've looked through that and you can see the numbers on how the last couple of months have performed using the strategies that I teach here on YouTube, let's dive into the equity curve and see how it looks since the beginning of my YouTube channel. As you can see, we left off on 4.11, which was April the 11th, was the last time I did a review video. And at that point, we had 98 winning trades, 79 losing trades, giving us a winning percentage of 55%. Our average loss in pips was 54 pips. Our average win was 67, giving us a risk reward of about 1.25. So with a 1.25 risk reward and only winning 55% of the time, we managed to accumulate 1,853 pips from the month of November of 2015 until April of 2016. And now let's see what the strategies have done since that point. If you'll keep an eye over here on the equity curve, you'll see that we have put in a couple of periods of drawdown. If you missed those videos, make sure to check them out. But right here was our biggest period of drawdown that happened from January the 21st all the way to March the 4th. So that was about 6 weeks of drawdown. And just to give you a better perception on that, think about if you were working a full time job and you went 6 weeks without a paycheck. How hard would that be to deal with psychologically? It's no different for a professional trader. Sometimes during these months of drawdown like you see here in the black box and like you see here in this black box. Sometimes during those periods, you make absolutely no money and they can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. And you just have to deal with it being a professional trader. The only way to deal with that kind of psychological battle is by having a ton of confidence in your trading plan. Knowing for a fact that you're eventually going to come out of this drawdown because you've tested it thoroughly through historical data and traded it thoroughly during a forward testing phase of your strategy. That's going to be the only way to have enough confidence to make it through these kind of drawdowns. So let's take a look at how the strategy performs since April. I'll just drag these numbers down and it'll affect the equity curve over here. If you want to just keep your eye over here, I'm going to drag it down one week at a time and show you how the strategies performed on all five of these strategies. I'll just perform on all five of those pairs each week since April. So the second week of April here, the strategy performed like this, putting us into, even further into a period of drawdown. The next week, the third week in April came in like this, breaking above 2000 pips, putting us into new equity highs. We were extremely excited about that. Finally heading in the right direction after about five weeks of nothing but sideways action on the equity curve was a big relief. Now the first week of May, put us up close to 2500 pips continuously moving up, but at the same time as you can see in here, we are having a difficult time moving up, putting in a few little drawdowns here and there, but nothing to be too concerned about. Next we moved down to our highest point of our equity curve, just above 2500 pips, which was obviously very exciting, but unfortunately since then, since May the 12th, we have been unable to put in any new equity highs. The third week in May looking like this, just consolidation as you can see, the fourth week in May looking like this, as you can see still just consolidating going on two weeks now of absolutely no paycheck, equity curve just going sideways, not making any money whatsoever. Finally the first week in June, we barely came above our equity highs here, I moved the box out of the way, this little spike here barely came above our equity highs, but still not really out of drawdown, as you can see still just consolidating sideways right above 2500 pips.
