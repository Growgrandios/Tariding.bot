Mistake number one is I had improper expectations. For some reason, I thought price action trading was going to be some kind of holy grail that helped me to win every trade that I placed, if I just analyzed the market enough and made the right decisions every time, then I would win every single trade and that's just what price action trading would do. Unfortunately, this goes beyond just price action. That doesn't exist in trading at all. Every trading strategy that you trade, whether it be based on indicators, price action, anything else, moon cycles, it doesn't matter. Whatever your trading based on is going to have losses and wins and you need to have the discipline and trading psychology to make it through that.
