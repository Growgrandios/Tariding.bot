Let's get this out of the way first. There is no magic candlestick pattern indicator or strategy that will make you rich over the next six months. And I know that sounds disappointing, but you can trust me. I have no reason to lie to you about that. Think about it. I'm a trading educator. So it actually benefits me if I tell you trading is easy. So I'm not saying this to disappoint you at all. I'm just telling you this to be honest because having the expectation of a YouTube strategy you learn, making you rich over the next six months, and then that dream, crashing down and burning is a feeling I'm all too familiar with. Something that happened to me at the beginning of my career. And I want to help you avoid that feeling. But what I can promise you is that the method I'm going to teach you in this video that only uses three very simple technical factors is something that has provided a massive edge over markets for me and made me a ton of money throughout my trading career. And it is something that I am positive if you implement will dramatically improve your trading as well. And how do I know this? Well, because the exact system I'm going to be teaching you in today's video is how I place the trade you see on the screen that's currently up about a seven to one reward to risk ratio on the New Zealand dollar. It's also the same exact system I use in order to place this trade here on the Aussie New Zealand that's currently up around a 2.7 to one reward to risk ratio. And now obviously, every trade does not win. But by the end of this video, you will know the exact three technical factors I combined and use every single time a place trades like this. That way, you can start placing trades like this yourself. So if that sounds good, go ahead and click that like button for me. Go ahead and subscribe if you are new. And I'll see you at the intro and disclaimer. These three technical factors are so simple that I can explain them in five minutes. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. Let's take a look at the New Zealand dollar. As you can see, it's a few days later now, we ended up getting stopped out on our trailing stop and making about a 5.5 to one on this trade. Let's discuss these three technical factors though. We're going to be using two different timeframes for this method. And our first technical factor, if you've been around the channel before, you know that I have a very big place in my heart for support and resistance levels. So our very first factor we're going to be looking for is a major structure level. So the very first thing we're going to do with this method of trading is we're going to get on our charts and we're going to look for a major level of structure that's pushed the market around in a dramatic way. This is how I try to define these levels. Zoom your chart out a little further than you normally would. Once you do, what you're looking for is the levels that stick out like a sore thumb. Now this will take a little bit of practice and it takes some experience to really be able to spot the correct levels. But what you're looking for are the levels that really push the market around in a dramatic way. These are the levels that you want to be paying attention to in your trading. Now these levels again will take a little experience for you to get used to. But once you get good at spotting these, these are the levels you're going to want to trade around. And again, this is going to be the first of our three different technical factors we're using in this method. One thing you don't want to be looking at is these little in between levels. I'm not looking at this as super good level of resistance. This is resistance. This is support. That's not the type of levels I'm looking for with this method. I am looking for levels that once the chart is zoomed out, stand out like a sore thumb. Those are the levels that I'm going to be paying attention to when I'm looking for major levels of structure. So now that we have that in check, what's something else that I use in this method in order to increase the accuracy of the trades? Well, it's something that I call htfic. Now that's just an acronym for higher time frame indicator confluence. So when using this method, I'm looking for some type of indicator confluence, and I'll give you the two that I use with this method of trading, I use either a moving average or the RSI being oversold or overbought. So in this case, we have our major level of structure pointed out here on the New Zealand dollar trade. We have price pushing up to that major level of structure. I want to be combining that with my second technical analysis factor, which is a higher time frame indicator confluence. For me, remember, I'm using two different indicators, either the 50 EMA, which is the moving average that I use, or the RSI being overbought or oversold. At this point, we have price right against the 50 EMA right against my moving average. So since we're right against the moving average and we are right here at a previous major level of structure, we have both of my two technical factors already initiated. These have already happened. So now, I just have to move on to the third thing that I look for. And as I told you before, we're going to be using two different time frames for this. So after having a major level of structure prices at and having that level being a level that also coincides with a higher time frame indicator confluence, like being right at a moving average or being overbought or oversold, the next thing I'm looking for is an entry on lower time frame. And that is how simple this method of trading is. A lot of people try to complicate their trading by using a ton of different indicators or a ton of different technical factors coming into it. But from my experience, if you add a lot of technical factors to a system or strategy or trading, you're going to decrease the frequency of trades that you can get to the point that if you're looking for, let's say five to 10 different technical factors on a trade, that trade may be very accurate, but you may only get three trades a year. So it's not really going to help you out that much if you're just combining a ton of different technical factors. On the flip side of that, the other side that traders tend to go to especially newer traders or traders that have been struggling for a while is just randomly placing trades at major levels with absolutely no other reason or randomly placing trades based on a candlestick pattern without looking for any other confirmation. So for me and the method that I used in order to get involved in this and the Aussie New Zealand, the three technical factors that are my favorite and that I've used for the past decade of my trading career in order to take advantage of the market are one, a higher time frame major level of structure, two, HTF, I see, which is higher time frame, indicator confluence, sorry, I'm losing my voice. And number three is an entry on a lower time frame, just to give you a hint on that 90 probably not 90 75% of the time. The entry I'm using on a lower time frame is going to be a double top or a double bottom. Let me show you what I mean. We dropped down now to the four hour time frame on the daily as you saw, we were at a major level of structure that pushed the market around dramatically. It was a sore thumb level. If you zoom your chart out, you can see it very easily. We did have higher time frame indicator confluence because price was at the 50 period exponential moving average. And down here on our lower time frame, remember 75% of my trades are using double bottoms or double tops. Now let's take a look at why I entered this trade here on the New Zealand dollar. What does this look like? We have price pushing up, one top, neckline double top, got some selling pressure at that double top, decided to go ahead and place that trade. And this trade was a trade I actually sent out to all of the members of the TTC Forex University. It's something called email analysis, there'll be a screenshot of it on the screen. This is something I send to traders between three and five times per week of trades I'm placing based on exactly what they learn inside of the university. So if that's something you're interested in starting to receive, I also send out all of the levels of structure I'm looking at. So if you have problems with levels of structure, that's something that may help you out and something you may be interested in. If so, click the link in the description or go to www.ttcfxuniversity.com. If not, that's completely fine too. What we're going to do now is take a look at another example of this where I use this exact same three step method, three technical factors in order to enter the Aussie New Zealand and make some decent profit on that trade too. This is not like some type of holy grail, but again, this is a method of trading I've used for years and that has consistently provided me with profits and an edge over the market. But just having a strategy is not all you're going to need to become a profitable trader. More on that later. Let's go ahead and dive into the Aussie New Zealand. I'll see you guys there. The first thing we have to do here on the Aussie New Zealand is look for our HTF, higher time frame, major structure level. So our higher time frame for me, I forgot to mention this before, is going to be the daily chart my trading time frame is going to be the four hour chart. So that's what I do. You can manipulate these time frames and use this for day trading as well. But personally, I'm a swing trader. And these are the two time frames I use for this specific method. This is what I'll be using throughout their major of the video. And right now, as you can see, we are on the daily chart of the Aussie New Zealand. We're looking for a major level of structure on that daily chart. Let's scroll left here on the Aussie New Zealand. We have to look left quite a long ways, but even with our chart scrunched up, as we were talking about earlier, the way we're going to find these major levels of structure is going to be to scroll back a little bit further than usual and point out all of the major areas that push the market around in a very dramatic way. And these are our levels. And that's the way I would suggest looking for these major levels. As you can see, we already have this one pointed out in our zone. So if we scroll back over to the right, you can see that that's exactly where price is at the time that we entered this trade on the Aussie New Zealand. So what's the next thing we look for after our major structure level, we must see HTF, I see, which means whatever timeframe you're looking for your major structure level on, in this case, the daily, that's the same time frame you want to look for your higher time frame indicator confluence on as well. Now, as I said earlier, I use the 50 EMA as indicator confluence, like right here would be indicator confluence for support because prices at the 50 EMA. I also use the RSI indicator for indicator confluence. So in this case, we're looking down at the RSI. By the way, my RSI settings are just completely stocked. It's just a 14 period RSI. Looking down here, you can see that price has in fact went above 70, which means over bulk only RSI indicator. So at this point, we have price at a major level of structure on our higher time frame. We have higher timeframe indicator confluence because not only are we at this major structure level of resistance, but we also have the RSI indicator going over bulk. So at this point, I have everything I need to go down to a lower timeframe and look for an entry here on the Aussie New Zealand. Let's do that. Now, on the four hour chart, you can see prices pushed up, but really no reason for entry yet. So let's keep pushing forward here. This candle to me was my entry. Now, I'm experienced and skilled enough as a trader not to have to have some kind of set and stone rule for entry. I use my own discretion here. And what I saw on this exact candle using my own discretion is the fact that we have all of these candles right back here trying to break above this highest wick. All of these candles fell to do so. Then when we did finally get a break above that highest wick, the sellers pushed the market down and we closed near the lows. That's the exact candle I decided to enter on. And after I entered this trade, price did in fact push down low enough for me to get a decent reward to risk ratio on this trade. We did play around a bit between the entry and stop loss first, but I ended up getting my profits off at around a 4.6 to 1 reward to risk ratio here on the Aussie New Zealand. And I'll also bring over an example of the pro trader report, which is something that comes with the TTC forex university as well. And if I scroll down here, and I'll probably zoom in on this to make it easier to see here on the halls in New Zealand, you can see that we pointed out our level of resistance. And I said that resistance area was between 1.1174 and 1.1134. If I go back to the chart, it's that area right here in red, if I go back over to the chart, you'll see that that's exactly where price of the Aussie New Zealand started falling from this red zone between 1.1174 and 1.1134. Now I did warn traders in the pro trader report that I was looking for sell opportunities in this area the week before. So if you want access to the pro trader report, and you want to start getting these every week, they are actually something that's also included in the TTC forex university. So if that's something you think would be beneficial to your trading, then we would love to have you aboard. You can get the details for the university by going to www.ttcfxuniversity.com. Okay, so now I want to give you a step by step process. You see becoming a profitable trader will never be as easy as watching a 20 minute video, and then going and trying to make as much money as possible with what you had just learned in that video. I wish that was the case, but that's not the world we live in as traders. And one of the biggest mistakes I see by far is traders consistently thinking about making money at the beginning before they've ever learned how to properly trade in financial markets. Now I know it's going to sound counterproductive, but at the beginning of your trading career, or even if you've been trading for a long time, but you are not profitable, you need to stop worrying about making money. Your main goal right now, if you are not consistently profitable with a trading plan that has proven to give an advantage over time, your main goal should not be to make money. So if your focus should not be on making money as a trader, then what should it be on? Instead of focusing on making money as a beginner, you should focus on learning how to trade. Now I'm going to put some things on the board while I talk here. What do I mean by learning how to trade? Well, the method I taught you works in all financial markets, stocks, crypto, forex, whatever you trade. So your first step is to learn the basics. Now if you're here on this video, I'm just going to assume you know the basics of whatever market you're trading. If you don't go learn the basics, pretty simple, right? After you have the basics down, you need to do exactly what you did in this video. Learn a bit about technical analysis and either create or learn a rules based method to trade around, to trade with. Now this is where most people make a mistake. They go from that to just going out here and trading it willy nilly for the lack of a better term. Instead of doing that, you want to go practice and perfect this system through the process of backtesting and forward testing over a large sample size of trades. One, this is going to get your rectangular activating system accustomed to seeing this exact three step process. These exact technical analysis factors coming together to create optimal trading opportunities. That's one of the reasons that we need to backtest and practice before we just go start trading out of the blue because of something we saw on YouTube. Number two, you don't know if this is actually profitable for the way you see the market. I've been trading for a decade. You may be brand new. You may have been trading longer than me. Irregardless, we probably see price, the market, our technical analysis slightly different. And with that being the case, that means that the way I trade may not perfectly work for the way you're going to trade it, even if we're trading based on the same method. So you need to perfect it and ensure that you see the market in a way that makes trading like this profitable for you. And thirdly, doing this backtesting forward testing, practicing with the strategy is going to give you an amazing amount of confidence. If it does go through two months of you practicing and you're up in your account over those two months, don't trade this with live money right now. Huge problem would be if you went out and just started trading live with what you've learned in this video. That's how you go about blowing an account because you'll go trade live, lose two or three in a row and you'll quit and switch to the next strategy and continuously bleed your account until you have no money left in it. Trust me, I've done it. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm speaking from experience. I've done these things. And I want you to learn from my mistakes instead of having to make them on your own. So instead of doing what I did, take this strategy that you have just learned as long as you already know the basics. Now you have a strategy, go practice it and demo trade it. Then you're still not done. At that point, you need to study up on risk management and trading psychology until you fill as though you've mastered those two things. Once you've done that and if you're asking in your head, you're like, Oh man, I don't even know how I would do that. In reality, every bit of information you need in order to learn any skill of trading is available for you for free on either Google or YouTube. You don't have to buy a course. A course is like an organized glossary that can get you there a lot faster. But if you can't afford a course, you can still research your way to being a profitable trader. So right now, if you don't know the basics, YouTube and Google, the basics of stocks, crypto or forex, whatever that may be for you. If you don't know, let's say anything about risk management, type in risk management in the YouTube search bar, type in risk management and forex trading risk management and stock trading, risk management and crypto, just type it in on the search bar and Google and on YouTube. And you will find pretty legitimate information 90% of the time about those topics. So you're going to need to master risk management and trading psychology. Once you've done that, still not time to trade live, then you want to create a full trading plan. Now a trading plan is just everything about your daily routine, along with the strategies or trading, along with the risk management plan you have. Maybe you write down your goals in it. It's completely up to you how detailed or how refined you get when it comes to creating your trading plan. For me, my trading plan looks like, what times do I trade? What times do I need to wake up to actually get by my computer and place trades? What is the exact strategies reason for entry? Everything else that I'm trading around? What is my risk management plan? And I journal at the end of every day. That's my trading plan. You're going to need one of those to become a profitable trader. And this trading plan is what we stick to in order to create profits over time in our trading. Something really important about trading psychology is these profits happen over time, not from one lucky trade. They are something that happens over a large sample size of trades. So if you have a week where you lose money, that's completely normal. I've been through months where I lost money throughout that month, but at the end of the year, I've always came out profitable. And so hopefully this little rant helped you want to understand the steps you need to take in order to become profitable outside of just taking what you learned in this video and trying to trade it willy nilly. Yeah, I'm going to start saying that a lot more now. I like the way it sounds. Just kidding. That sounds gross. Number two, hopefully it motivated you and helped you to understand that losses are a part of trading. They do happen. And number three, hopefully this entire video helps you to master my three favorite technical analysis factors to put together in order to create highly accurate trading opportunities.
