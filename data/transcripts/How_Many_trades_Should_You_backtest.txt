Back testing is the process of looking through historical data for entries to a strategy that you've either learned or created on your own And we do this to find out how accurate a strategy may be now You can learn a ton about a strategy by doing this and personally I've tested over 10,000 trades throughout historical data and also spent thousands and thousands of hours doing this And in today's video I want to show you guys one of the most important things that I learned throughout the process of doing all this back testing So how many trades should you actually test throughout a back test? The answer to that coming up after the intro and disclaimer if you're new here to the trading channel I'd like to say welcome My name is Steven your honest trading coach And if you are new and would like to be notified when we come out with a video like this each and every week helping you on your path to success in trading Go ahead and click that subscribe button and the notification bell to the right hand side below the video Also, go ahead and click that like button for me while the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll be right back on the other side So So this video is gonna be somewhat on the shorter side But it's gonna be full of a very important point which is how many trades should we actually be testing during a back test? And there's an arbitrary number that goes around that most traders believe which is that we need to be testing 100 trades per pair and per time frame in order to get an accurate prediction on how a strategy may perform in the future Now something I've learned during my thousands of hours of testing and testing tens of thousands of trades is that that is not true at all And more often than not the number is much higher than 100 Sample size is one of the most important parts of back testing and before we get into the actual number or anything like that Let's talk about the purpose of back testing The entire reason we do this is so that we can get an accurate look at how a strategy could possibly perform in the future So in order to make this prediction we need to put the strategy we're gonna be using through different market conditions markets trend Consolidate reverse there's different things that markets going to do and what we have to do is make sure that we prepare ourselves for those Situations throughout the back testing process. So what if you test 100 trades? But during your entire testing period the market has done nothing but trend and you have a trend continuation strategy That'd be in the case the strategy is gonna win more often than not and what are you gonna do though when the actual Life market goes into a period of consolidation and you lose five ten trades in a row at that point You're gonna stop trading your strategy You're going to jump to a different system quit trading or lose your account because your risk management plan is not set up properly Because of the fact that you did not test different market conditions So how do we solve this issue because this is a problem for a lot of traders? This is a question I get asked on a daily basis and the way we solve this is by going through more data During our back test. Yes, 100 trades would be a minimum. I guess you could say but what's a number that you should actually use? Well, the number unfortunately is completely arbitrary meaning random. It is not based on a number That's not really important how many trades we go through the more important part is that we have enough trades to put us through consolidating and trending markets with a certain strategy another very important part of back testing is that we back tests Enough trades for us to be confident in that specific strategy moving forward so we can stay disciplined that strategy now on your screen in front of you You can see we have the New Zealand dollar pair. This is a pair. I've been testing for a strategy We're gonna be learning in the new EAP training program. I'm going through the last period of testing This was actually the last pair I tested and this is gonna give a good example of what I'm talking about So on this pair let's go ahead and move towards the charts the New Zealand dollar All this was was a few different entries. That's why you see different colored arrows It was four different entries on overextended markets is what I was testing and throughout the testing process I first started from 2014 to today's date. It's on a four-hour chart That being the case from 2014 to today's date gave me a 64% winning percentage Very good winning percentage for me. I like anything above 60. So I was very impressed by those numbers now That was about 95 trades from 2014 to today's date What happened when I went back to 2011 and tested those three years again? The number does not matter to me the fact that I was at 94 trades didn't mean that I didn't want to test anymore I was actually not confident enough in the strategy yet to take those 94 trades and then base an entire trading plan around that Information and start trading it with a lot of money. I wanted more trades. I needed more market data I wanted to see markets that were consolidating and trending throughout this test So I tested three more years going all the back to 2011 the results may surprise you The 94 trades which most traders again believe that 100 trades is how many you should do during a test There's how many you should test during a back test That's what is believed by a lot of traders that have heard of back testing some traders haven't even heard of it But that being the case the 100 trades Remember we were at 94 in 2014 to today's date 94 trades Gave me a 64% winning percentage now the year before that 2013 this strategy actually lost More than it won and the year before that we had the same situation So going back two more years put me at about a hundred and ninety trades throughout the past three years actually from 2011 to today's date Gave me a little less than 200 trades doing that the strategy went from a winning percentage of 64% down to a winning percentage of 56% almost a 10% difference in winning percentage just based on the fact that I went from instead of testing 100 trades to testing Almost 200 trades again the number is arbitrary But I went from just testing and trending markets to testing more so consolidating markets back in 2011 all the way up to around 2013 on at least on the four-hour chart now the significance of this is imagine Having a 10% difference in winning percentage based on your trading plan you've created around a strategy, right? You test a strategy. It's got a 60 5% winning percentage you create a trading plan around it meaning a risk management plan you have everything you need in order to create a trading plan after your back test and That's what you begin to trade in the market with is the trading plan you've created based on the 100 Back-tested trades that you have now tested Well, what if during your live trading your winning percentage is 10% different to the bad side? Do you know how badly that would affect your drawdown? Do you know how to adjust your risk management plan? Appropriately based on that well the truth is no because you haven't tested enough trades So in this video I just wanted to help you to realize that Although the arbitrary number of 100 may be a good minimum to start with on a back test That number is what I used to see if I want to continue testing after I've went through 100 trades if I have a above a 60% winning percentage then I'll start testing more trades up to the point that I'm comfortable with the Consolidation and trending markets that I have tested and again the significance of that could be major Just as with this New Zealand dollar pair on the strategy that I've now created and that we're gonna be talking about in the new EAP here in just a couple of days this strategy over the course of a hundred trades performed very well and would have been in My portfolio of pairs to trade with this strategy based on those numbers But going back a couple of more years going through about a hundred more trades and market data Enlightened me to the point that now I'm not gonna be placing this in the portfolio for this strategy because the winning percentage is just slightly too bad So the takeaways from this video should be the fact that the number of trades is Completely arbitrary and the fact that you have something extremely profitable or Something above a 60% winning percentage or whatever it is you look for in a strategy throughout 100 trades That does not necessarily mean that that's gonna give you a good representation of how that specific strategy is gonna perform in the future You may end up needing more than that 100 trades the arbitrary number that most traders believe is Enough during a back test to predict how that strategy is gonna perform in the future So guys keep that in mind throughout your back testing journey There's no set number But I would never start trading a strategy or base a trading plan around a strategy that I had not tested at least 200 trades and Five years of market data at least for me that I'd test most of my strategies on a four-hour time frame And even if I'm on the hourly time frame, I need three to five years of market data regardless of The amount of trades that is so that's a better way to really look at it is go through an amount of time a specific amount of time Instead of a specific amount of trades as I said for me on a four-hour chart I want to say at least five years of market data before I'm comfortable with the results of that back test for a One-hour chart you may look at three years of data and that would be my minimum number instead of saying a minimum of 100 trades Do a minimum of a certain period of time?
