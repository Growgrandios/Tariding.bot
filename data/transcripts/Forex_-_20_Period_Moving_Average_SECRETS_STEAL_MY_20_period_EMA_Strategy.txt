Hey guys, welcome to today's video. I actually have a question to start it out on Monday morning whenever Monday rolls around The market opens. I'm assuming that you trade if you're watching this video when the market opens on Monday morning What are you trading based on? Are you trading based on a trading plan or a certain strategy that you use those are good scenarios or are you trading based on assumptions? Are you sitting there trading based on a motion saying oh it's at support the markets at support? Let's say the euro dollar the chart roll now hitting a support level. I know it should rise from this level. I'm placing a trade That's not a strategy. That's not a trading plan. That's gambling. That's an assumption and today I'm going to show you how to actually gain an edge over the market as usual We're going to start by creating rules for trend and structure And then we need to create rules for a specific strategy We'll go over all that in today's video along with looking at the top five major pairs I'll share with you guys some of my top trading ideas on those top five pairs for the upcoming week So if that sounds interesting to you make sure you're subscribed here to the trading channel join the over 150,000 trader community we currently have make sure to click that like button for me while the intro and disclaimer roll I'll catch you guys on the other side So there's a reason that I'm bringing this topic up today throughout the past couple of weeks at least for my personal trading things have been Very very slow. I think I've had three or four trades in the past two weeks all together And what normally happens especially to newer traders and traders that are still struggling to make profit is they Tend to be almost addicted to the rush of placing a trade and because of that it makes it nearly impossible for them Not to trade even when markets are slow and there's no trades based on their strategy or their trading plan If they actually have one so no matter which category you fall into this video is gonna be extremely beneficial Let's start like this Most traders and you may fall into this category Say something like this whenever markets are slow or whenever something's not meeting their trading plan or if they just don't have a strategy They say okay, I've heard on the internet that I'm supposed to be buying at support So right here the euro dollar made a support level. I'm gonna place a buy order They place the buy order their stop losses down here They say well the internet also said that from support Normally a market makes it back up to the previous resistance level which would be right here and they say I'm expecting this right? They're assuming that's gonna happen with no previous data to prove that it's happened in the past with with going pretty much on nothing Just an assumption and gambling then they lose money and they say ah trading sucks I'm never doing this again or they continue doing it bleeding their account slowly This is gambling if you fall under this category It's time to change things to get you on the right path to trading success. So how do we do that? Well? parts of a strategy are Rules based at least for a rules based strategy was what we're gonna discuss today You need to have specific rules for your strategy that you can take and test in previous data for instance I'm gonna share a strategy with you right now. So be sure to pay attention You can also take out a patent opinion and go ahead and write these rules down What if you said that you're looking for a volatile trend now? That's a very subjective thing to say volatile trend. What does that mean? What if you made a rule for that that a volatile trend means that the markets under the 20 period moving average? That's a pretty fast moving average for some people. So with that being the case Let's say we're waiting for the market to be under the 20 period moving average When the markets under the 20 period moving average you're looking for a Trending market while still under that moving average or above it depending on the direction of the market that you want to be going Longer short and we're gonna discuss more about this later on it all makes sense in just a second. So The two rules we have so far is a trending market under or over the 20 period moving average With that being the case We have to now define a trending market because that's a subjective term as well. That's something we can't really objectively Define without rules. So a trending market is going to be a market making lower lows and lower highs Something like this would be a trending market. So once we get a market that's trending Under the 20 period moving average now we have to start coming up with either new different conditions or new different entry reasons So what are we gonna do next? Let's talk about entry reasons? So in this exact scenario right here. We have a market pushing down under the 20 period moving average We have a pullback and we go into trend what we're currently looking for and let's just add another condition Here is a market that pulls back to the previously broken level of structure By the way guys right here if the market was right here at this exact point then right here would be the previously broken Level of structure. So with this previously broken level of structure What we're looking for is the market to pull back up to that while staying at or under the 20 period moving average Which we do here and then Once we get there we needed a finable entry reason after we have that we have a rules based strategy We only have to worry about stops and targets afterwards. So currently we've created a strategy We're waiting for a market that's under the 20 period moving average to trend based on creating higher highs and higher lows or lower lows and lower highs And then we're waiting for a pullback to the most previously broken level of structure Now we have to create an entry reason this is the whole process of creating a strategy which is And pretty much a very large part of creating a trading plan So creating the strategy we're now back up at this previous level of structure Let's say the markets right here and we're waiting for an entry reason and actually what I'll do is do the market replay I've had a lot of questions about this market replay on trading view is just right here All you have to do is go to the top of your trading view platform click market replay Take this red line and put where put it wherever you would like the market to replay from right there is what we'll do We'll say that the markets right here using the strategy. We just talked about the markets now in trend We know that because we've made a lower high We've pushed down to a lower low based on our previous low This was our previous low and our previous high now We've made a lower high and a lower low putting us in a downtrend now that we're in a downtrend We know we're looking for what well based on the rules. We just created. Hopefully you have them written down We're waiting for a pullback back up to the previously broken level of structure support Because we're under the 20 we're under the 20 EMA with that being the case. We'll go ahead and do this bar by bar Excuse me. Did that completely wrong? Sorry about that guys Okay, let's hit that one. Okay So now we'll go bar by bar. Sorry about that. Let's go ahead and do this remember we're waiting for a move back up into our Previously tested level of structure not previously tested excuse me previously broken level of structure support So if we go forward moving moving moving we get there. All right. We're in our zone now that we're in our zone We have to create an entry reason and let's say for simplicity sake We're gonna use a lower low lower close entry reason when a shorting scenario in a higher higher close Intrusion in a long scenario. What does that mean? Lower lower lower close is a candle that looks like this as you can see we have a lower low and a lower close Then the previous candle that's is that's all we need right for entry based on this little strategy We're using you can make up your own entries and use a shooting star candle and engulfing candle different candlestick patterns double tops double bottoms That's irrelevant the point of today's video showing you how to create a rules based strategy So this is what we need to have is all these rules in place and now that we know we're waiting on a lower lower lower Close we can continue going forward What do we get right here? I zoom in the chart? You can see that right here We got a candle with a lower low compared to the previous candle and a lower close than the body of the previous candle Lower low lower close candle that means we enter the market now that we have our entry We have our entry reason all the conditions we need our strategy is pretty much built But we have to make rules for when we're gonna get out of this market for when we're getting out of the trade That means we need rules for stops and we need rules for targets. So how are we gonna do that? Well a good idea for stops would be to have stops above the previous swing high right well That's absolutely true That's definitely a place you could put stops, but that's irrelevant What you want to have is rules in place and you're gonna know why in just a second I'm gonna explain why these rules are so important but what you want is rules in place for a Stop loss and a target no matter what those rules are you can have a 10 pips up in a 10-pip sorry target That's irrelevant and I'll show you why in just a second, but what we're gonna use well once I get that off the screen is a Stop loss that's 10 pips above the previous swing. Just again being very simple 71 that's gonna be an 81 pip stop All right, we have an 81 pip stop. We're gonna use previous support actually We'll use a one-to-one risk reward as our target. Okay, so there we go. We have our trade set up. We'll move forward Moving forward moving forward and we get stopped out before we hit our targets So we should have had a bigger stop at this point you can adjust your stop loss that say we would have done It's a it's a daily chart. So really we probably needed a bigger stop loss We'll do something like this and just pretend we won the trade The point is you have rules for a strategy now The reason you want rules for stops and targets for the conditions for the entry reason that you use is not so that you can just play Strades blindly based on this knowledge every single time it happens in the market You want these rules because after you have them written down Hopefully you wrote down all these rules again pick your own entry reason because the conditions that I gave you are solid They're very good conditions for a train continuation strategy for looking for the market to continue in a certain direction using a volatile trend Meaning under the 20 period moving average using the break of structure Being those lower lows and lower highs or higher highs and higher lows is also a good thing And then you picking whatever kind of entries and you want to use and picking whatever kind of stops and targets You want to use yes, you're gonna have to do work this video isn't gonna give you the secret to profitable trading although this video Literally has given you the secret to profitable trading which is get a trading plan in order the trading plan starts with a rules-based Strategy which is what I literally just gave you right here in this video So create your entry reason create your own rules for stops and targets once you've done that the point of all of this Is so you can take these rules and you can go back in previous data you can scroll this chart back You can take your market replay tool. You will have all of your you have all of your Rules in place you'll have them written down beside you on your desk with your stops and targets with your all your conditions You need to see and what you can do is take and scroll the chart back with your market replay And you can just scroll forward and see how many times those rules happen out of the amount of times those rules happened With your stops and targets how many times did you win versus lost see how this strategy that you have created now performs in historical data how it performs in historical data is going to show you a Decent projection as to how it could possibly perform in the future And if you're just trading blindly without bag testing then you're trading one Based on a strategy that you have no clue how it's performed in the past which is should be scary as hell To your trading based on a strategy you haven't practiced yet So back testing also gives us the ability to practice trading in the market without live money at risk, which is extremely beneficial so For those of you who've stayed till this part of the video I hope you take this information go out there actually create the rules for entry create the rules for stops and targets and test this for yourselves In historical data see how it performs leave comments below if it's helpful leave comments below about the performance of it So other traders can can be inspired to test this as well I just wanted to give you guys this as a thank you for the support you've all given me throughout the past three years here at the Trading Channel. I hope it's helpful. I hope it's beneficial. This video is going to be extremely long We're already 10 minutes deep, but right now what I'm gonna do is break down the top five major pairs using structure trend and Other types of technical analysis in order to give you a projection on what I think those pairs the top five major pairs are going to do Throughout the rest of the week. So let's go ahead and dive into that right now Before we jump into the top five major pairs this week If you would like the entry stops and targets that I use for the strategy You just learned the 20 EMA strategy that we just talked about then what I'm gonna do is actually be giving that away for Absolutely free for a limited time just as a thank you for all of the support I've received here at the trading channel So if you would like to get your hands on the video You see on your screen all you have to do is click the link in the description labeled 20 EMA to get my entry stops and Targets for this strategy all you'll have to do is actually put in your email address and I can send this video directly to you So do that if you're interested if not, that's cool, too. Let's go ahead and jump back into today's video Okay, traders. So now moving on to future projections on the top five major pairs We're gonna start on the euro dollar daily chart as usual We're gonna do this on the daily chart to give you guys an idea of what I'm looking for in the upcoming week Only stop five major pairs and something to keep in mind is that there's a huge difference between analysis and trading Analysis gives you projections of where you think the market's going to go But trading is based on what I just showed you which is an actual rules based strategy But what we're gonna do right now is analysis and make projections on where we think the market's going to go So here specifically for the euro dollar as always I start on the daily chart and I ask myself two questions Where what is the trend of this current market and where are the most relevant levels of structure that I'm paying attention to? Currently on the euro dollar. We are in a downtrend. Let me explain why we are in a downtrend here on this currency pair If we use this as our starting point, which I am going to do we have a push down a pushback up a push down that does what creates that? Lower low This was our lower high now. We're in trend that's all we're looking for to determine to define our rules Right for a trending market or we need a lower high and a lower low It's exactly what we get right here is a lower high followed by a lower low now We're looking for a continuation of that trend as we push up. We then get a new lower high and Lower low now things get a little confusing here, right? We're still in a downtrend. I would explain exactly why but we have a higher This right here. This is a higher high than our previous high But we haven't closed above this resistance level and until we do until we get a close above that previous level of resistance I still consider this market in a downtrend in my overall expectation is that eventually key word Eventually this market pushes down and creates new lower lows Not not saying that's gonna happen right now And and the reason I say that is because one of the most prominent levels of structure. I'm looking at is right here this market has just come down into a level of support that is held for a very long time and in many different situations and you can tell that by Looking at the market here. We have support support support. You can call this another test of support This is another test of support. So with the market right here This is also a head and shoulders pattern at this big major level of support. What does that mean in? In reference to our trading or in reference to my trading in reference to my trading what this tells me is that we could See a bounce out of this market now. Could we see this market completely reverse and go up? Yeah, there's no way of knowing what the market or exactly what the market is going to do The only thing I can trade based on is my analysis and my strategy So what I know based on my analysis is that we're at a key level of structure that could provide a bounce now The beauty of doing this analysis on the daily chart is that if you trade any other timeframe you can right now say Okay, this is a zone Of support I'm looking at this right here as a zone of support because it's tested It's been tested multiple times in the past now that we're at this zone of support What I want to do is change my bias instead of being short because we were in a downtrend instead of being short now My bias is long just until we get out of this zone. My bias is long to see a move higher a possible bounce out of this market Now, I'm not looking for a complete reversal. Although that may happen What I'm gonna be looking for at least for first targets is 80 to 100 pips out of this move out of this Euro dollar pair right here around the 1.1274 level. So at this level again as an area I'm gonna be looking for possible long trades now if we get below that level I have another level of possible support right here at 1.12 even which is another level I'll look for possible bounces from something like this could definitely happen and then I'll look for another countertrain bounce there Along with the fat guys that if this market pushes down below this zone, I'll be looking there for possible short trades That's that's in the future though. That's way in the future. So we won't talk about that quite yet as for resistance if this market Pushes back up to this level right here again We get another push like this right here then that's the level I look for a possible bounce to the downside again From these levels. I'm dropping down to smaller timeframes. I'm looking for 80 to 100 pips I'm not saying that when the market gets this resistance level we're gonna see a major decline We absolutely could but that's just too far in the future for me to determine and what I can trade base around what I can actually use in my trading Is knowing that we're likely to get these bounces of around 80 to 100 pips from these zones of structure that have been tested multiple times So that's what I'm looking at on the euro dollar. Let's go ahead and move on now next currency pair We'll take a look at is the pound dollar. I will delete my analysis here so far All right, same thing let's start with what is the trend of the pound dollar? This pair is in a period of consolidation. That's easy to see but the Minor I guess you could call it underlying trend is up at the moment and the reason for that is because we've had a market that pushed up When we pushed up we broke and closed above this previous level of resistance. We then pushed down into a higher low compared to our previous low and this was our higher high Compared to our previous high then we get another break putting us in a trade continuation We pull back. We've now retested that level what I'm waiting on right now is a pullback I need to see this market at least get back down to this level of structure around 1.3 Before trying to place a trade because at the moment we're just in no man's land here on the pound dollar But with that being the case, let's actually since we're in no man's land Talk about what we're waiting on next and where we can actually look for trading opportunities at if the market gets back up too This level of resistance at 1.3 304 around 1.33 1.33 even at that level is a level we can look for possible or I'll be looking for possible Shorting opportunities and as the market pushes back down again as I just said around the 1.3 1-0 level that's a level I'll look for possible long trades out of the pound dollar So that's kind of what I'm gonna be looking at when it comes to trading on the pound dollar All of that's in the future that's gonna be starting Monday And it'll probably take a couple of days for the market to get to either of these zones But that is the analysis on the pound dollar. Let's move on now on the dollar yen and here on this pair We have a market that is just broken structure to the downside meaning that we're now in a down trend Let me explain that to you. We started from down here had our push up push up that broke resistance That means our new higher low and our new higher high has been established We then created a trend here But recently what have we done if we draw our line right here? Let me zoom in because this just could absolutely be getting hard to see for you guys. So zooming in here This was our previous level of support. We are now pushing below that level. It is friday So if we close below that level today, then what I will be looking for out of this pair is Up but up Bro excuse me is a potential reversal in trend meaning that we've been trending up And now i'll be looking for a possible reversal to that uptrend I'll be looking for the market to head lower and then give me some kind of pullback to the 110.25 level Or a pullback up into this resistance for me to go short out of the dollar yen That's what i'm looking for here out of the dollar yen. We'll move on now to the all Z dollar Only all Z dollar Big period of consolidation. I'm not even gonna do analysis on this pair There's really nothing i'm looking for unless this pair gets back down to around This level of structure at 0.7 even other than that This is a sit on my hands type pair. I'm not going to be doing anything in terms of trading with this pair until we get down to This zone in green or possibly up to the zone around 0.7 208. That's the only times I'll be looking at this specific currency pair for a trade next up We have the dollar swiss the dollar swiss I'll delete all of my analysis so far start over has just broken Structured to the downside broken and closed below This level of structure support meaning what are we expecting a trend reversal? We were in an uptrend from here low to a high higher low higher high We pull back we create a trend by breaking and closing above Then we push down we break and close below now we're expecting a possible potential reversal and in this potential reversal There's a few different areas or at least a couple of areas. I'm looking at for possible shorting opportunities The market got close to one today throughout the rest of next week. I will be looking at this area right in here between 0.99 5 and 1.0 I'll be looking at that area and really closer to the 1.0 area for possible shorting opportunities out of this pair based on the reversal We've just seen and if the market makes it back up to this resistance That's another level. I'll look for possible shorting opportunities to the downside When it comes to levels of structure that i'm looking for for possible long opportunities out of this pair The one that pays that stands out to me is right here The reason for that is because of the amount of times this level has been tested in the past So if this market can push a little lower or if we do get that short trade This is the level i'll look for targets at as well as be looking for possible long opportunities out of the 0.9872 level This of course is a zone of structure support that's been tested multiple times in the past and it could react as support once more For the dollar swiss and that my friends is the end of an extremely long video I am parched my mouth is extremely dry from talking so much So I hope there's been extremely beneficial for you if it has make sure to click the like button Make sure that you're subscribed here.
