The break and retest strategy is one of the most essential strategies in Forex. And before you go thinking this is just another video telling you to buy it support or sell it resistance. That's not what we're doing today. In today's video I'm going to teach you a strategy I personally have spent thousands of hours testing and adapting, creating this set of rules that creates this strategy that is like having a cheat code for a video game. The strategy is like counting cards at a blackjack table. No, of course you don't win every trade. No one's capable of doing that but just like counting cards at a blackjack table what you do is give yourself an advantage. And that advantage over a long period of time is what creates consistent profits. It's what creates a winning percentage that can help you make massive returns over time. So if you want access to the exact rules and the exact adaptations that took me personally thousands of hours to perfect. If you want access to the strategy that helped me go from a struggling trader consistently losing money to a professional trader with consistent profits.

I'm going to let the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll see you directly afterwards to help you perfect the break and retest trade. Welcome back traders. Okay, so let's go ahead and dive right into today's video dive right into the strategy. What we're doing with this strategy is avoiding moments in the market just like what you see on your screen. Moments in the market where the market is consolidating this consolidation can eat you alive if you're trend trading or trading breaks and retests of structure. And the reason is you might say we're in trend. Look at this big move up right I'm going to buy because we're in trend. I'm going to put a stop loss right down here and a target up here and in consolidation. Unfortunately the market normally doesn't hit that target comes down and it'll stop you out and then you'll go. Oh shit we're going lower now I need to go short. You go short somewhere like right here looking at this pullback. Retest waiting for the market to push down but instead it comes up and clips your stop right here. You've probably seen this before in your own trading if you've tried trading breaks and retests or tried trading trend during periods of consolidation. So the first step is to avoid moments like this. What this is going to do is give us a higher winning percentage which overall means a larger profit by the end of the year by a large number of trades. And so the way we do this is what I'm explaining to you right now. I'm going to explain that to you in this strategy. But before we look at the strategy itself let's take a look at a couple of trades we had in the EAP training program last week using a very similar strategy to this break and retest strategy. So I can explain the strategy to you give you an overview and then we'll dive into the exact rules directly afterwards. Let's take a look at those trades now. So on the screen right beside my face you can see a trade on the dollar swiss. This trade was based on the break and retest strategy I'm teaching you throughout this video. And let's go ahead and go look at how that trade played out. Now if we just scroll the chart over a little bit this was that actually this was actually that trade right in this area. So what were we looking at here? Let me do a very quick overview of the entire strategy and then I'll break down the rules a little bit more so afterwards. So with this strategy what we're looking at is we want to see a market in a volatile trend. How do we define a volatile trend? Well for me personally I define a volatile trend as a market trading under the 20 period EMA exponential moving average. So if we're trading under that 20 period EMA then I'm defining that market as in a volatile downtrend. If we're in a volatile downtrend then that's when I want to start looking for these break and retest trades. So let's go ahead and go over these rules again don't get confused. This is going to be a very fast overview and then I'm going to go through the rules slowly so you can completely understand it. But what I'm looking for essentially as a market trading below our 20 EMA pulling back to it getting pushed off that 20 EMA and breaking the previous level of support. At that point is when I know I'm in a position to have the best possible chances of winning a retest trade. How so what I mean by that is now is when I'll be waiting for a retest of this level right here. If I have this whole situation happening market was trading under the 20 EMA market pulled back to the 20 EMA market then broke the previous level of support. That's when I'm ready to start looking for the retest and an entry reason for the market to go lower because through the thousands of hours of testing that I've done and historic data what I've realized is that this is one of the most important things that I've done. And historic data what I've realized is that this is one of the most accurate ways to trade that retest is having a market below the 20 in a volatile trend pushing off the 20 breaking the previous level of structure and retesting it at that point when I want to start looking for trades. I'm going to show you one more example of this right now on the screen. This is a trade on the euro and based again on the same exact rules that you're about to learn. So on this year again let's go ahead and take a look at it and I'll pull up the chart and we can look at the trade itself in this specific scenario we had a market that was pushing down we're trading above the 20 EMA here right the red line on the screen is the 20 EMA we have a push off the 20 EMA pushing this market much higher. We then pull back into our previous resistance level when we get back into that previous resistance level I got a trade entry from right around in here entry at a stop loss right under this level and a target right back up here at previous resistance just like you see in the picture or saw in the picture a second ago. So that's using the same exact system now what I want to do is break down the rules themselves look at a few examples and get you to a point where you can master this type of trade which can give you an edge over the market and provide those consistent profits we were talking about earlier. So let's take a look at some examples of this and go through the full rule set right now. Alright so let's go ahead and talk through the rules what I'm looking for I'm going to have this red line is the 20 EMA price will be in blue. So what I want to see price doing is trading above the 20 EMA creating a high and for a swing high have very simple rules for swing highs and lows a swing high is a high that was previously had two green candles and afterwards has two red candles at that point. This is a swing high for a swing low my rules for that are the exact opposite price coming down I want to see a low that had two red candles before it and has two green candles after it at that point this is considered a swing low for me. What I'm looking at is the swing highs and lows and that's what I need to see broken so in this case I would need price to be pushing above the 20 EMA then I would need to see price create that situation where we have a swing high with two green candles before it, two red candles after it and then I need price to be bouncing off of the 20 EMA and breaking that swing high. If we do this we bounce off the 20 EMA showing me we're in a volatile trend we break above the previous high at this point what I'm waiting on is a pullback to that previous high which I define as between the wicks and the body of that previous high I'll show you that on a chart in just a second. But what I'm looking at now is this market to pull back into that level and give me an entry reason to head higher again. This is going to give me that best possible trade setup. It does take a lot of patience which is involved in trading but this gives me the best possible accuracy on break and retest trades at least from the thousands and thousands of hours that I've spent studying this type of trading strategy. So this is what we're looking for for a bullish trade. Let me go through a bearish trade and then we're going to take a look at some examples and some more specific rules and just a second. Let's do a bearish example right now though. Okay same thing here guys blue is going to be priced the red lines of 20 EMA for a bearish example I would need price to push below the 20 EMA come back tested and be pushed off the 20 EMA breaking the previous swing low. Once that happens I need price to come back to that previous swing low and give me an entry reason once that happens I'm ready to place that trade is going to give me that best possible trade setup for a break and retest trade because we're going with that volatile trend. And using these rules we're staying out of consolidating markets increasing winning percentage on any break and retest strategy no matter what entry reason you use or targets or stops use and that is something that you can use in order to create consistent profits over a long period of time. So we've done a bearish example and a bullish example now we're going to take a look at some charts and I'm going to explain these rules in a little more detail using actual charts. So let's head down to a chart now. Okay so here we are on the euro dollar. As you can see on this chart price has been a bit choppy right price has been consolidating here between the areas around 1.14 and around 1.118. Between these two areas price has just been going back and forth we haven't really seen any big moves out of these areas and what I want to do is give you an example of how we keep ourselves from getting into trades during these periods of consolidation with just the rules that I've shared with you so far. So take a look at that. Here in a bearish direction we have a push down push back up push off the 20 when we pull back up to our zone here do we get an entry reason at all. No we do not so we just keep looking for that optimal time to place a trade with a break and retest strategy. We then pull down to candle up that makes this a swing low we need to see a break of this we don't we get this new low we need to see a break of that we finally do get a break of that. In our zone we get this huge red candle but that's a massive candle I wouldn't be taking a sell down here at the previous lows so that would not have been a trade we then push up push back down push up do we ever get that test of the 20 push up breaking close above resistance here. No we don't get that at all until about right here we get the breaking close above we get a pull back down we get a green candle not a good entry reason though and what we're going to use in this example for an entry reason is going to be a shooting star candle and a hammer candle. So in this position this period of consolidation on the euro dollar what we've done is avoided losing any trades during a consolidating market which is going to again increase the accuracy of any trend continuation strategy. So now that we've looked at an example of how we stay out of trades in consolidation let's look at examples of this exact set of rules at work. So right here already see a good example of this we're going to be pushing above price of price needs to be above 20 right 20 EMA red line price needs to be above it. So let's just look here we get a push up what do we need for a swing high it needs to have at least two green candles before it to red candles after it does this match those rules. Yes it does we get a pull back we get a break and close above this level about right here. So what we have here pull back breaking close above we get a pull back into our zone and a nice candlestick pattern for entry stop below the swing low targets wherever you'd like to put them 1.5 risk reward. We're going to continue doing this and we're going to show you how this keeps you out of consolidation and can help you to get a more accurate strategy based on trend continuation. So as we push up higher we're looking for that next swing high that has at least two red candles going down we have that right here. So this would be the swing high you know breaking close we get a pull back that pull back doesn't get back to our zone so we have nothing there. We then get another move up to our next swing high two red candles coming down the pull back the breaking close. Now we're coming back into our zone right when we come back into our zone we get this nice hammer candlestick at that hammer candlestick. So I'm going to go ahead and give you an example of exactly how I'd be placing this trait. I'd be doing something like that the hammer candlestick has an ATR of 37. So if I have 27 here I want to add 37 pips to that because I want it to be a 1 ATR below the swing low stop loss. So let's do that math quickly it's 57 plus 7 which would be 64. So we have a 64 pip stop and with a 1.5 to 1 risk reward like we just talked about we hit those targets pretty easily. So that's an example of how to use the strategy itself to win a trade in this example again. As we talked about earlier of course no strategy is going to win all the time what we're trying to do though is create an advantage where out of 100 trades we can be profitable. Maybe even excessively profitable very profitable out of 100 trades and then if we can get 100 trades every 6 months we can find a way to be consistently profitable as traders and that's how you start a professional trading career. So that's an example of a bullish trade using exactly what I've taught you in this video. Let's look at a bearish example and then we're going to do something kind of special. I'm going to back test this with you over a period of time maybe like 3 to 6 months and we're going to see how it performed over the last 3 months on a currency pair that I'm going to randomly pick from the right side of our screen. So let's go ahead and look at one more example let's look at bearish and then we'll do that. Okay guys here's an example of a bearish version on the one hour chart on the New Zealand dollar just showing you you can use this on any time frame I say use take that back do not use this go test it on other time frames figure out if it's something you want your trading plan and go from there when it comes in terms of creating a trading plan around it. Do not go out and just use this blindly you will lose money forex has a substantial amount of risk that risk is increased dramatically if you don't put in the work you need to which testing a strategy is part of the work you need to. With that said, see if you can spot the trade the strategy we just discussed on the New Zealand dollar right now. Hopefully you were able to see this we have a market trading below the 20 period moving average we have a push up to the 20 period moving average and what do we need now a break of that previous swing low. We have a break of that previous swing low followed by a pullback into that area and a shooting star candle right here in case you're wondering the exact rules I use for a shooting star and hammer candle. I don't call them that I call them 33.3 candles because all I need to see is a candle that has a open and close in the lower third for a shooting star or an open and close the full body of the candle and the hot in the top third for a hammer a bullish candle and what what that means essentially and what a very easy way to do that is grab a Fibonacci retracement. Go from the high of your candle to the low of your candle if the entire body of that candle is below 33.3% of the entire length of the candle then I count that as a shooting star. Opposite for a bullish hammer. Now let's look at how we would have placed this trade. Remember we're just the close of that candle is going to be the entry. We will then take a look at our ATR of that candle which is 17 pips. We want to be 17 pips above the high of that candle. With that being the case we have seven let's do the quick math plus 10 to be 27 minus three would be 24. So we have 24 when we try to look here for about a 1.5 and we get a 1.5 to one risk reward right here. So this would be another example a bearish example of using this type of strategy in order to capture volatile trends and using this entry reason in order to place trades in the market with a stop in a target. Exactly as I just described take it test it do what you will with it what I'm going to do right now is give you an example of actually back testing this for about three months. Let's take a look at that right now. So first off let's take a look at a full overview of the strategy itself. This is a trade we had at about three o'clock a day and let's go ahead and look at it. Look at the chart tell me can you see where this trade took place. Remember for this strategy we're looking for a market to be trading above the 20 EMA. We want to see a pullback to the 20 EMA and we want to see the creation of a new higher high when we get that new higher high. So for example at this point right here what we're going to do is create an area between the wicks and bodies of that high that was just broken. This is a break and retest strategy after all and then when the market gets back into that area we're waiting to see if the market prints a candle that looks very similar to this. Do we get a hammer candle? In this specific case we did and as you can see the market took off to the high side in terms of placing this exact trade. Once I get that hammer candle what I like to do is just place an entry on the close of that candle and a stop loss below the low of that candle by one ATR. So we're on the five minute chart we're going to have a very small ATR of eight pips right here we're sitting at four four plus eight is going to be twelve. So we have a twelve pip stop and for a target I like to use a one point four to a one point five to one risk reward. As you can see this market took off and hit that quite easily earlier today so this is an example of one that happened really recently three o'clock today and just a full overview of the exact strategy. Remember trading above the 20 EMA pulling back to the 20 EMA creating new highs. Here's our zone waiting for the market to get back in that zone and create that entry reason candle. So that's a full overview let's go ahead and hop back to the rest of the video. Alright traders so after realizing that this video itself is already over 15 minutes long I've decided to do something else.
