So, traders, having an extensive understanding of trend and key levels that the market may use to resist or support price action are absolutely necessary skills for any technical trader. These skills will access the foundation for most profitable technical trading strategies, and for any trader, these skills will be a large contributing factor to success in a financial market. So if reading trend and understanding these key levels of structure is something you struggle with and if you'd like to learn how we use these two factors to create very accurate trading opportunities, then make sure you're subscribed here to the trading channel because we come out with videos teaching about these two topics each and every week.

I'm going to let the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll see you guys on the other side. Welcome back traders. So before we get into the actual weekly market predictions and taking a look at these top five major pairs, discussing what we're looking for out of them. Perhaps I want to go over exactly what we look for when it comes to trend and identifying market structure. Just in case there are some of you watching this that are new or in case you've been watching these videos for a while these weekly market prediction videos and you really don't understand exactly what I'm looking for for these potential trading zones. I think this will really help you so quickly. I will go over it. This is going to be very brief and we do have more extensive training on structure and trend. Of course, in the EAP training program, our paid program, but also free material if you decide to sign up for email list that we send out to everyone. So if you want more in-depth training on structure, those are a couple of options for you. Otherwise, let's take a look at the chart. So for trend, it's very simple. We're looking for a series of higher highs and higher lows. This is all we're looking for guys. The market's making new highs, new higher lows, then that's considered an uptrend. If the market is doing the opposite of that with lower highs and lower lows, then we're calling this a bearish trend. We're calling this a trend. We want to hop on in that direction. So let's go down to the chart and quickly look at some examples of each of those here on the euro dollar. Initially before we ran into this red line, this is on up here, we were in an uptrend. How do we know that? We're making new highs, new lows, new highs, higher lows, new high. And then all of a sudden from that new high, we make an equal low, a lower high. First time we could be in a bearish trend, lower low, giving us bearish trend. Now we make a equal high, higher low, higher high, giving us back to a bullish trend. What does that mean? Well, that means now we're looking for bullish trades here on the euro dollar. And so now that we've went over a little bit about trend, what I'm going to do is quickly go over market structure and how we're identifying major levels of market structure. And again, guys, I realize this is extremely fast, but for more in-depth training, you can check out the two links in the description. So here we have a market, let's say, that looks like this. At this point, in order to identify key levels of market structure, all I'm going to do is take a look at one standalone levels. That means levels like this that are out in the middle of nowhere by themselves or levels of structure that have been touched multiple times by the market. This would be an example of that. We have the market respecting this level once, twice, and three times. So that was a brief description of what we're looking for when it comes to trend and structure identification. Now, let's go ahead and get into exactly what we're expecting out of these top five major pairs throughout the rest of this week. And throughout the video, we'll also be taking a look at last week's market predictions and how they played out as well. All right, guys, so let's go ahead and get started with this week's predictions on the euro dollar. And we're going to be making these predictions based on the two factors we just discussed. Key market structure and trend. So what are we looking at when it comes to trend on the euro dollar? Will we just discuss this? We're in a downtrend until the market pushed up, creating this equal high to our previous high, a higher low and is now broken structure to the upside, putting us into a new trend. This is going to now be an uptrend, meaning we're looking for long opportunities on the euro dollar. Well, if we're looking for opportunities to go long here on the euro dollar, one of the main places I'm going to be paying attention to is right here. We have one, two, three, four times, and five, if you count this week here, that the market has touched this level around 1.1857 and respected that level, either using it as resistance or support by this market. What that's telling me is that this is a major level of structure that we could possibly see a reaction from. So combining the two things we just talked about, knowing that the euro dollar is now in an uptrend based on my analysis and knowing that we're back down at a major level of structure means this is an area I can look for a long opportunity. This is what we do for each of these pairs every single Monday, guys. We go through the market, taking a look at what trend the markets in and what key levels of structure it's around and discuss how we can actually take potential trades from these levels. So now that we've discussed trend, let's talk about the key levels. We've already talked about the 1.1857 level here for the euro dollar. This is the first area we're looking for a long opportunity. And if we pull back even more than that, let's say we go all the way down to the 1.1686 level, that's another level we can look for a long opportunity from. And that's something we'll be paying attention to throughout the rest of this week for the euro dollar. Now, as for shorting opportunities, we're looking for resistance. If this market does get pushed up around the 1.2060 level, reason for that, as we discussed, standalone level out here all by itself also has been touched multiple times by this market. We also have another level of resistance above that that more than likely we will not touch this week, but in the future we'll also be paying attention to the 1.2223 level as our next level of possible resistance here on the euro dollar. And that's what we're going to be expecting here out of the euro dollar in the future. Now something really important for those of you who are new or if you've been watching for a while and you haven't heard me explain this yet, these levels are not 100% accurate. So do not go out and just blindly start trading these levels. It's just really important for you to have a vast understanding of structure and trend in order to create your own profitable trading strategies. And that's why I create these videos is to help you guys understand structure and trend more so that you can go out and create your own strategies in the future. So keep that in mind as we go throughout the rest of today's video. Our next pair we're going to take a look at is going to be the dollar Swiss. So here on the dollar Swiss our email analysis from last week worked out really nicely. Last week we talked about this market pushing up getting close to our 0.9873 level. We thought this level would act as resistance and push the market all the way down to our 0.974 level and that that level could act as support and push the market back up. As you can see that's exactly what this market did. And just so you don't have to take my word for it I'm actually going to play a clip from last week's video showing you guys this analysis before any of this price action even happened. So let's take a look at that clip and I'll be right back. Let's take a look at what we're expecting next out of this market. Well we have now broken below this previous level of support at the 0.9873 zone because of that this level is now going to be acting as resistance meaning that if the market pushes up from where it's at right now and we get to the 0.9873 level we'll be looking for shorting opportunities and trend continuation from that area. We'll be looking for that area to push the market down to the 0.97402 zone. That's our next level of support where we're thinking of taking that second position off along with looking for some counter trend opportunities to the upside. Now if we push below that. So traders again here's our 0.9873 level right here is the place we were talking about resistance in last week's video and the market possibly pushing down from this level 0.974O level we talked about a support and getting a possible push up from now the way we identified this accurate prediction was using the exact factors we talked about the beginning of this video using identifying trend and combining that with major market structure. So before we had this uptrend in the dollar Swiss making higher highs higher lows all the way up till we got pretty close to the 1.0110 level out of the dollar Swiss and then we pushed down creating what could be another higher low but proved to be the next level of support we would break and give us a hint that this could be a market going into a downtrend because we knew that based on our trend analysis we were looking at a major level of structure using the same analysis we talked about in the beginning of the video and waiting for the market to give that level to place a trade. So that's how we identified this level here on the dollar Swiss and also how we identified the support level looking into the future. What are we expecting next out of this dollar Swiss pair? Well we're pushing back up towards our 0.9873 level in this zones where we'll be looking for shorting opportunities out of this pair. If we break above it the next place we'll look for shorting opportunities as 0.9946 this will be our next level to look for a possible move to the downside out of this pair. There's also a scenario where this market gets pushed down from the resistance level we're at right now. If so we'll be looking at the 0.9740 level yet again for support and below that we'll be looking at support around the 0.9633 level for the dollar Swiss. So that's our analysis and predictions on the dollar Swiss we'll go ahead and move on to our next pair the dollar yen. So last week we talked about this 113 even handle as being a place the dollar yen could find resistance and as you can see the market pushed right up into that level and since then has found some resistance and pushed down. Now the reason we were expecting this level to hold as resistance and the reason we came up with this prediction is because of the two factors we discussed at the beginning of this video major levels of structure and understanding trend as you can see the dollar yen made an impulsive move down breaking below structure after that pushed up to a level of structure that's been touched multiple times as we identified earlier in the video and since then has pushed down just as we expected from last week's video. So what I'm going to do is play you guys a clip from last week's video and then we'll come back to discuss what we predict will come next for the dollar yen pair. Let's take a look at that clip. Now on this pair we also have a little level of resistance right here. That's another level we'll pay attention to for resistance around the 113 even handle. So there's a detailed breakdown. So our prediction last week was that this 113 level would hold and that's what's happened so far. What are we expecting next now out of the dollar yen? Well of course now that that level has held as resistance and pushed down a little we're actually expecting this market to push all the way down to the 111.79 area that'll be our first level of support that we're looking for for the dollar yen. If we push below that we can look around the 110.47 area for our next level of support. With that being the case we're going to go ahead and turn this line to blue instead of red to indicate support for the market and the red lines indicate our next levels of resistance. So if we push down let's say hit these first targets and then push back up we can expect resistance around the 114.23 level really in between that and the 114 even handle anywhere for some type of shorting opportunity. We push above that around the 115 even handle will be another place we look for short trades here on the dollar yen. And that's what we're expecting in the future here for this pair. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair which is going to be the Aussie dollar. So here on the Aussie dollar not much has changed since last week we're not going to spend a lot of time on this pair. Last week we discussed this as being a possible level where we're going to see some consolidation in between here because we have so many major levels of structure in this area and that's exactly what's happened. What we're going to be looking for in the future is to see if this market can push above our major level of structure around the 0.7627 level. That being the case we'll start looking for some long opportunities up to our next resistance level around 0.7735. So that's our two levels of resistance here for the Aussie dollar and if we push down from this level we're looking for see if we can get some support off the 0.7534 zone. If not if we push below that we can look for some shorting opportunities down to 0.7459 and that's what we're going to be paying attention to here on the Aussie dollar in the future. Let's go ahead and move on to our last pair which is going to be the pound dollar today. Last week on the pound dollar we discussed this little yellow box this area as being a place we could look for long opportunities on this pair because we had already broken out of our period of consolidation right in here. Once we've broke out of that period of consolidation we talked about this as being an area we could see the market pull back into and then push back up. Well if you look at this in Candlewick it's kind of difficult to see here on the daily chart but this Candlewick pushed down right into that area and ended up pushing the market all the way up giving us a pretty nice trade up to the 1.355 area right in here. So what I'm going to do is play you guys a clip from last week's video talking about this area being an interesting opportunity and then we'll come back and discuss a little more about the analysis behind that actual trade and what we're expecting to see in the future out of the pound dollar. The pound dollar the market looking as though it could break out of this period of consolidation that we've been out of the past couple of months and we finally do break above that period of consolidation. What we can look for is a pull back into our yellow zone we pointed out last week between the 1.3305 area which is our black line and the 1.3246 area which is our red line. The market pulls back into that area we can be looking for some type of long opportunity to continue the newfound trend which should be up after breaking out of the resistance level of this period of consolidation. So the pound dollar working out quite nicely based on the analysis from last week as well what we'll actually do is head down to a smaller time frame and make this easier to see. So let's go down to the 4 hour chart. As you can see on this chart the market did in fact start breaking and closing above our previous resistance levels which were right in here and then we got this pull back into the exact zone we were talking about a pretty big candle giving us some buying pressure and since then the market pushed up. Now we've actually pulled back down into another level of support so let's head back out to the daily chart and talk about what we're expecting next out of the pound dollar. So for this period since we broke above our 1.344 level we're actually expecting to see that level act as possible support for this market and push us up to our next resistance level which could be 1.3597. As the next place we can look for some short encounter trend opportunities on the pound dollar. Zoom the chart out and we actually have another level of resistance that we have to find for the pound dollar. Looks like we've already got it pointed out I'm just going to make it a little brighter so it's easier to see. The 1.3853 level will be our next level of resistance. I don't think we'll have to worry about that level within the next couple of weeks but that is something to keep an eye out for. Now for support out of the pound dollar. We break below our 1.3449 area that we're currently looking at as support and the market is currently hovering around. We're looking back at this yellow zone yet again for another possible entry to the upside. Around the 1.3246 level. Now if we get below that 1.3056 will be the next level we look at for long opportunities here on the pound dollar. So that is a detailed breakdown of the pound dollar and of the top five major pairs in the 4X market.
