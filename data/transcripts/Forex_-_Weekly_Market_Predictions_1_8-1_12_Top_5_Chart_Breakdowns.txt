Well, this week we have this previous level of resistance that's been broken now We see that the market's pushing down One of our highly likely scenarios is that we push down Around this area somewhere in this box we're creating here and we get some type of entry reason to go long Possibly another retest of this 1.20 6.0 level that's going to be the first thing we're looking out for here on the euro dollar is the test of this 1.19 2 area 1.193 area in that level and in this zone is where we'll be paying attention to for long opportunities on this pair Now some other scenarios is the market could just push up from where it is now and retest the 1.2060 level if that happens We're looking for shorting opportunities there if we break above that level our next level of resistance is around 1.23 Even in that area is another level we can look for counter-trans shorting opportunities Just as we did from this level here Another scenario we could see is the market pushed below that level of previous resistance Coming all the way down into our next major level of support around 1.1845 This is where we'll be looking for more long opportunities if the market does break below this 1.1925 level And if we break yet again below that then we'll be looking back here at these previous support levels Market using this area as support multiple times in the past around 1.1714 This will be the next level of support. We're looking out for here on the euro dollar But again our most likely scenario this week and the area that the market will have to travel least to get to Is around the 1.19 even to the 1.195 area in that area looking for some type of long opportunity On a lower time frame for trend continuation here out of the euro dollar And that's our breakdown here on the euro dollar. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair pound dollar Last week the pound dollar was coming up to this previous level of resistance We thought this might be a level where the market would push down from because of this standalone level of resistance back here around 1.3597 That's exactly what this market did we came up into that level And we pushed down a little over a hundred pips similar to the way the euro dollar pushed down from that previous level of resistance We were looking at earlier. So that was our predictions for last week out of the pound dollar Now what are we looking for going into this week? Well, the first thing we're gonna be paying attention for is after this big push down the market is now made a rally up If we rally up back into 1.3597 that is going to be a place where we're starting to look for some more counter trend Shorting opportunities out of this pair now the other situation we could see this week is this market pushing down Getting closer to this zone right in here that we're going to be paying attention to For long opportunities out of the pound dollar. So if we get down into this zone This is where we'll be looking at on the pound dollar for opportunities to go long out of this pair and trend continuation as you can see It's market just now broke above a previous level of resistance and before that we broke above this period of consolidation We had back here looking left. So with that being the case We have a possibility of this market continuing up and if we do that, what are we going to be looking for? We're going to be looking for long opportunities if we can break above 1.3597 Long opportunities all the way up to 1.3853 Which after some trend continuation out of the pound dollar could be the next place we see resistance out of this pair The market pushes down from here the 1.3449 in that area The zone we pointed out just a second ago is going to be the first opportunity for long trades If we push down even further than that the next level of Possible support that we see is the zone back here around our period of consolidation right in here somewhere between the 1.3305 And 1.3246 that'll be the next zone we look for for long opportunities Probably not going to happen within this week But these are things we can pay attention to here for the future on the pound dollar Now let's go ahead and move on to our next pair which will be the dollar in here on the dollar in we're still in this period of Consolidation what we were looking for last week is this market to push down to our 111.7 9 area for some support We never to get down to that area instead the market pushed up found resistance yet again around 1.13.5 We actually talked about this as being a level of resistance in last week's video So for this week on the dollar again, we're gonna be looking at two different zones the first place we're paying attention to for trading opportunities on this pair It's going to be this zone right here up top. We're looking at this market traveling up to This previous level of resistance between 1.13 even and 1.13.5 Pushing up to that zone giving us some kind of opportunity on a smaller time frame To take this as a short trade from this zone of resistance Another thing we could see this week is this market push all the way down to this zone Of support we now have this zone here acting as support Around the 112 even handles if the dollar yen pushes up to that resistance level Let's say we meet this resistance level in this period of consolidation and push down from that The next zone we'll be looking at for support is somewhere around the 112 even handle That's what we're looking at for the immediate future here on the dollar yen above and below those levels If we get this breakout and it keeps going higher we're going to be looking around the 114 even handle Between that and 114.23 is our next zone of possible resistance After this zone we have around 113.5 as we go lower below our first zone of support We were just talking about we'll be looking back here at this standalone level around 111 even on the dollar You have for possible long opportunities and that's what we'll be paying attention to here on the dollar yen throughout this week And possibly a little further into the future. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair Which is going to be the dollar swiss last week here on the dollar yen We were talking about the 0.97 39 level is being a possible level of support for this market The market pushed down into that level and then pushed right back up on the very next candle closing back above that level Giving us an indication that we could see this market reverse here from as you can see the downtrend We've just created we now have a downtrend because we broke below this previous level of support So here instead of being a downtrend and on a lower time frame You can definitely see this being a downtrend but instead of being a downtrend now What we're expecting is this market to find support from the 0.97 39 level as long as the market stays above that zone So if we continue higher here, we may be looking for some long opportunities Down on a smaller time frame coming off this support level if the market pushes down below this support level The first thing we'll be looking for is this level to turn into resistance We'll be taking short trades off this level if that happens all the way down to the 0.96 3 3 level which is going to act as our next level of support here on the dollar swiss If we get that move up that we're talking about it's a possible long trades on a lower time frame Second targets for those trades will be somewhere around 0.9849 That's the next level of possible resistance that we have here on the dollar swiss And another level we can look for some possible shorting opportunities from this could be a good train continuation level as this market As we just talked about as put in a low lower high lower low This could be where we see that lower high come in right in the 0.9849 level above that If the market gets a nice rally from this support level, we'll be looking around this previous resistance level at 0.9945 So those are the major levels that we're paying attention to here on the dollar swiss Now we'll go ahead and move on to our final pair which is going to be the Aussie dollar Okay, guys, so the Aussie dollar from last week we were paying attention to this level in our red line here as resistance And we were thinking we could see a push down from this level here on the Aussie dollar Well, we did not end up getting any kind of injuries in on this trade We also did not see a push down from this level whatsoever. Instead the market Continuing this big strong move the Aussie dollar has had in the past Couple of months pushed all the way above that level of resistance and is now starting to pull back So what do you think we're gonna be waiting on this week out of the Aussie dollar? Well upon this pullback if we can get all the way down into the 0.7819 level of previous major resistance we were looking at This is the first place we're going to be paying attention to for trend continuation out of this pair to take some long trades From this level so if the market can pull back into that level this week we'll be looking at that area for possible long trades See if we can capture some trend continuation all the way up to the next level of resistance we have A 0.7893. That's the next level we'll pay attention to for counter trend opportunities And above that we're gonna be looking a long ways up at 0.8023 So that's what we're looking at for the immediate future here on the Aussie dollar and also for resistance What are we looking at for support other than this previous level right here at 0.7819? Well, if we get below that level that level will then turn into resistance We'll be looking at that level as a possible place to take shorting opportunities all the way down to our next level of support around 0.7730 If that level breaks as well, we'll be looking for support around 0.75 So as for the immediate future here on the Aussie dollar looking at this 0.7819 level Right in here as being a possible level of support Pay attention there this week for some possible long opportunities and trend continuation out of the Aussie dollar That's going to do it for today's video guys If you would like a little more detailed education on how we use these structure levels to trade along with how we trade in general Including the strategies we use the risk management techniques we use and how we master discipline in our trading here at the trading channel And even outside of the programs that we offer Throughout 2018 some of the best advice I could give you would be get educated If you lost money throughout 2017 and you're going to do the same exact thing in 2018 Then chances are you're going to continuously lose money in the market or either give up trading altogether So the answer and the way that you get around that is by becoming more educated on the topic of trading And whether you decide that you like the way I trade and the way I teach and you'd like to be a part of the trading channels programs Whether you decide that or to go somewhere else is really irrelevant It's just important for you to actually invest in your education And the only reason I say that guys is because it's very rare that someone goes through Tons of random forex education on youtube or on other free avenues and actually becomes profitable from it We do have a lot of organized education here on the trading channel Even on the free resources we offer like the training you get if you decide to sign up for our email list link in the description Or the training you get just here on our youtube channel for free It's a little more structured than most places, but there's just so much information out there And it's so difficult to stay organized when you're just watching strategy after strategy or you're watching different ways to identify structure and trend It can get extremely confusing unless you have an organized System in place that teaches you step by step how to go from not being profitable to creating your own trading plan using the correct risk management Becoming discipline in your trading and eventually becoming profitable So if any of that sounds like you and you're interested in investing in your education that we do offer a couple of programs here Then there are two links in the description below One for the eep training program and for those of you who are interested in advanced patterns We've also just released the advanced pattern mastery course Both of those go over discipline in a high degree and also talk about risk management Along with the actual strategies we use on a daily basis to profit in the forex market That'll do it for the shameless plug guys Links for all that are in the description again.
