Hey trainers, one of our key topics in today's video is going to be the importance of sticking to a plan and the importance of having rules that give you an edge over the market. We're also going to take a look at the trade you see on your screen which managed to bake in around 150 pips overnight. So an incredible trade, we'll look at the analysis behind that trade as well in today's video.

If you don't mind going click that like button for me while the intro and disclaimer rolls and I'll see you guys on the other side. Welcome back trainers. So we're going to talk a little bit about having a rules based trading plan that gives you an edge over the market and a little bit about psychology later on the video. We'll also be taking a look at a spreadsheet that'll show you how having a small edge over the market can actually produce some pretty incredible gains over the long run. But for now, let's go ahead and talk about the technical analysis that went into the trade you see on your screen. So this trades on the New Zealand yen and this is a trade we sent out in email analysis to all the traders in the EAP training program on the 17th of October. So let's take a brief look at that email. All right guys. So here's a quick look at that email and as you can see it was sent out on 10 17. And if we head back over to the New Zealand yen chart and now we're going to talk a little bit about why we were interested in this as a trading opportunity. In order to do so, I'm going to zoom out to the daily chart out here on the daily chart. Do you guys see anything interesting about this level where the market was at? This market was at a level of structure that had been tested multiple times in the past as support and resistance. As we came back up into that level, we started to look for some type of entry reason based on the trading plan we have at the EAP. So we head down to a four hour chart. You can see that we had some levels of structure that lined up really well here on the four hour chart as well looking right here. We also had this level of support. Well with the market pushed up to this level, we ended up seeing a pretty nice entry reason down or a lower time frame right in here. We got involved based on that entry reason right around in there and this market pushed up almost stopping us out overnight getting about 15 pips away from our stop loss. And then last night pushing down to put us over 150 pips in profit on this trade. And this is a situation where a lot of traders would not have been able to make this trade work. The reason being most traders would have gotten so scared when the market was up here. 10 15 pips away from their stop loss that as soon as the market got back down and put them in a little bit of profit, they would have exited their position for a total of about 15 pips in profit, maybe 20 pips in profit. That's what would have happened to 90% of traders. Or even worse, they may have taken the position off up here and said, okay, this is going to stop me out. I'm saving myself 10 pips of stop loss. Well, if either of those situations would have occurred for a newer trader, then they would have missed out on this huge move down that gave us over 150 pips in profit. And the reason I know that some traders made that kind of mistake is because I've been there as well. I've made those same mistakes. So this is why it's so important to have a rules based plan and to stay disciplined to that plan. My plan told me this is where my stop loss should be, right? 81.04. And unless the market reaches that stop loss, then I do not exit the trade for loss. That's the difference between a profitable trader and a professional trader and just a retail trader that joins the 90% of people that end up failing trying to do this. Now, another key point we're going to get a little bit into the psychology side of this now is that this trade was placed using a specific set of rules, right? You probably understand that by now. I've trade based on a specific set of rules that I've created and that we use in the EAP trading program. And unfortunately, most retail traders perception of a professional trader is a little bit skewed. Most retail traders think a professional trader is just better at picking winning trades. They know a secret that the retail trader doesn't know when that's not really the case at all. There is no secret behind what I'm doing. I'm following a set of rules that I've created and I'm staying disciplined to those rules and to prove that point even further, this trade was placed on that set of rules that I'm talking about and it ended up being 150 pip winter, right? Incredible trade. Well, something else that happened throughout this week is that we place this trade as well using the exact same set of rules down to the entry reason the levels of structure we saw we use the same exact set of rules to place this trade. This trade lost 71 pips. I'm not better at picking winning trades. I'm better at following my plan and staying disciplined to my plan. Hopefully, this is kind of an eye opener for any of you who have been struggling with this. Every trade is not going to win. No matter what your rules are, no matter what your strategy is, every trade will not win. Your point is to give yourself an edge over the market through a process called backtesting to figure out what actually gives you an edge. Once you have that edge, you follow that plan as closely as possible. So in a sense, yes, you become better at picking winning trades, but you become better at picking winning trades because of the rules based strategy you've created because you're following those set of rules. If I were to go out in the market without a set of rules and just start trading random trades, I would be no better than the 90% of traders that fail. I may be able to break even because of my knowledge of the markets and structure and trend. But if I wasn't following the specific set of rules that I've created, then it would be very difficult for me to be a profitable trader. So let's talk a little bit about what a small edge over the market will do for you. In the EAP training program, we track all those trades in a spreadsheet. And this spreadsheet shows that we have around a 57% winning percentage and a little over a one to one risk reward. Not an incredible edge over the market, right? We're not winning 80% of the time. We don't have a two to one risk reward on every trade. But if we head over to that spreadsheet, this is what that can do for you. As you can see here, we have a 57.45 percent winning percentage, just a little better than five out of 10 trades, one or 50 out of 100, we have a 1.19 risk reward. Now imagine that we're losing 43 out of 100 trades and we just have a little over a one to one risk reward. We've had around 141 trades so far in 2017. Out of those, we have 81 wins, 60 losses. We've managed to accumulate a little over 4,500 pips, almost 4,600 pips. We have a 109.5% return. Guys, think about that. With a 57% winning percentage and a 1.19 risk reward, we've been able to accumulate a 109% return in a little over 10 months. Now, this is using money management. This is also using two separate positions or two targets. And otherwise, this number would be much lower. It'd probably be around a 45 or 50% return if we weren't using money management and two targets. But nonetheless, still only having a 57% winning percentage and a little over a one to one risk reward can produce a massive return at the end of the year. You don't need to find the strategy that wins 80% of the time and gives you a two to one risk reward. If you could just give yourself a slight edge over the market with a strategy and stay disciplined to the rules you've created, then you can create a substantial gain over the course of 10 months to a year. And guys, I'm going to show you the equity curve as well to show you how important it is to stick to the trading plan that you've created. You have to stick to the plan through the drawdowns. Otherwise, this isn't possible. And what I mean by that is if we take a look down here at the equity curve right in through here, you can see some equity consolidation, right? No new highs made throughout this area. There's another area right in through here, even bigger, where there's no new highs made. There's an area in through here of consolidation where there's no new has made and an area right here. These are called periods of consolidation or periods of drawdown. Now, on the spreadsheet and on paper sitting here staring at this equity curve, they don't look like much because we can also see these big moves up, right? Well, guys, in reality, whenever you're actually trading this drawdown, we had no new equity highs for over a month. During this drawdown, we had no new equity highs for eight weeks, a full two months of no new equity highs. Imagine actually going through that in real life. Imagine that you're a professional trader trying to provide for your family through this. And you have no money made over the course of two months. You don't make any new equity highs in two months. How stressful would that be? This is why psychology is so important in trading and staying disciplined to your plans because in these two months, if you would have quit throughout these two months, you would have completely missed this huge run up that we've had recently. If you would have quit right here, you would have completely missed this big run up. This is why it's so important to have discipline and have the right mindset whenever you are trading because otherwise this type of return is not possible. So guys, make sure you have a plan that gives you an edge over the market. Make sure you're sticking to that plan by being disciplined and understand that we all lose trades. This same analysis, this same exact strategy and the same exact entry reason was used to lose this trade on the pound Aussie professional traders aren't better at picking winning trades. They're better at following their plan. They're better at staying disciplined to the plan they have. That's why they're professional traders. Guys, if you're interested in learning a little more about the EAP training program, then there's a link in the description labeled EAP. In that program, you'll learn a little more about the strategies and techniques that I use personally in my own trading and this helped plenty of traders throughout their journey to becoming profitable. Also, if you don't have a spreadsheet like this to track your trades, then you're at a huge disadvantage. You really need something like this, especially during your back and foretesting process in order to calculate your drawdown and calculate risk management and money management in association with your risk tolerance and your goals when it comes to a winning percentage over the course of a long period of time and having a spreadsheet like this is essential in doing so. If you'd like to learn more about how you can get your hands on this spreadsheet, then once it's available, I will put a link in the description for that. It's not quite available yet, but as soon as it becomes available, there'll be a link for that as well. Otherwise, guys, remember to stick to your plan. Remember that we all have losses, but it's our ability to get over those losses and fight through those drawdowns that will make you a better trader.
