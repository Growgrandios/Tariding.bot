When I first started trading, I deposited money into a trading account and just assumed that I would be able to be profitable after doing so. Let me give you an analogy that I think will make that make more sense as to why that's not the case. If you wanted to be a doctor, would you walk into a hospital and start trying to reattach someone's ligament? You probably wouldn't, right? And I know that seems like a far-fetched example, but essentially that's what we're doing if we just deposit money into an account and try to start trading without ever learning how to trade. And you may be thinking, oh, but Steven, I've got a guy that sends me signals on text message. You walk into a hospital, you start attaching someone's ligament that they had torn, and then all of a sudden, they go, hey, I think you're doing that wrong. And you say, it's fine. I'm getting text messages from a doctor who knows how to do it. I think I'll be okay. So what I'm really trying to say is it makes zero sense for any trader to start trading with lab money until they have learned how to trade.
