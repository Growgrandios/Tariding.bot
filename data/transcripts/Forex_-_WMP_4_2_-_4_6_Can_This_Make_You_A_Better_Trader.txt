Hey traders, welcome to the trading channel and welcome to another weekly market prediction video. Before we get started today, I actually have a question for you. What if you could accurately predict what any market was going to do every single week based on nothing but two very simple principles, major levels of structure and trend? Well, in these weekly market prediction videos, that's exactly what we try to help you guys be able to do. So if that sounds like it's going to be valuable for your trading, make sure you're subscribed here to the trading channel, make sure to click that notification bell to be alerted when these videos come out every single week. Also click that like button for me while the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll be right back to give you guys some valuable content and to start today's weekly market prediction video. Okay guys, so let's go ahead and start off today's analysis on the euro dollar and when you're doing top down analysis like this, one of the better ideas is to go ahead and point out one specific thing about the market on this daily timeframe. And what I like to do is point out the trend of this market before looking for structure levels. So what trend is the euro dollar in? Well, it's quite obvious that the euro dollar is actually in a period of consolidation, meaning we don't have a very defined trend. What we can say is that this move down broke below a previous level of structure. So if any bias, we have a slight bias to the downside, but it's not necessarily in trend at this moment. So what does that mean for our trading? Well, during periods of consolidation, we know that we have a pretty high likelihood of this market bouncing off of support or off of resistance. So for our initial predictions here on the euro dollar, our initial trade idea is that this market pushes down just a little bit further into the 1.225 area. And once we get down to that 1.225 area, we can look for long trades based on the bounce off of this previous level of support. Now, if we get a break below that level, without getting any kind of entry reason, then that level will immediately turn into resistance because we have this slight short bias based on this previous level of structure breaking here. So that level will immediately turn into resistance and we'll be looking there for possible shorting opportunities. If we do get that break below 1.25. And of course, if we get a push up all the way into 1.25 here, as resistance, that's a place we'll look for possible shorting opportunities here on the euro dollar. So that's our expectations here on this pair. Again, just in this period of consolidation, looking for bounces off of support and resistance with a slight bias to the downside. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair now, which is going to be the pound dollar. So here on the pound dollar, last week, we actually had a prediction that this market would come into 1.425 zero and have a push down from that area. I actually put a screenshot of that to the left hand side of your screen. As you can see, that prediction worked out really well from last week. And the reason we made that prediction is because this market was coming up into what we considered to be a major level of structure looking left because of this double top scenario we had. So we thought once the market got up to that level, that would be a really nice place to look for possible shorting opportunities. We ended up getting a nice push down from that level. Well, now that that's happened, let's talk more about what we're expecting next out of this pair. So for the pound dollar, we've already had this push down and this push down just happened to break below the 1.4, 1, 0 level. But without giving us an entry reason, we talked about getting a possible long entry from this level, but we got no kind of entry reason on any time frame from that level. So considering that and considering the market is now broke below that level, that's going to turn into a nice place for us to start looking for possible short opportunities here at the trading channel and for trend continuation on lower time frames. Let's go ahead and take this down to a four hour time frame. So I can show you guys a bit more of what I'm talking about here on the pound dollar. So here on the four hour time frame, you can see that we've just had a head and shoulders pattern. This being shoulder, head, another shoulder, the breakout. And we know that that neckline of the head and shoulders pattern can be a great place to start looking for possible trend continuation opportunities. Well, here we have a market that did that, created an impulsive move to the downside breaking below that neckline. And has since began to consolidate up. What does this look like? Well, it looks like an age old pattern that we can use for trend continuation, which is called the flag pattern. Also, if we get this breakout of the flag pattern, of course, that's a possible way for us to take this market to the downside in trend continuation. And other than that, we're looking for a pullback up into 1.4, 1, 0 for a possible shorting opportunity here out of the pound dollar. And that's our initial predictions for this week on this pair. So now if we discuss the pound dollars, go ahead and move on to our next pair. Our next pair in today's video is going to be the dollar in. Okay guys, so here on the dollar in, we're actually involved in a trade in the EAP training program based on this type of analysis. I'll put a, I'll put a screenshot of that trade to the left hand side of the screen. What we're looking at here is a major level of structure around 105.6. This is all level we've been taking a look at for a while now. And we actually expected this level to help us in trend continuation and push this market further down last week. But as we talk about a lot here at the trading channel, your job is not to know what the market is going to do, but to be prepared for any situation the market throws at you. So the market through this situation, it does. We pushed above our major level of structure instead of finding it and creating trend continuation. After we pushed above it, we knew that that level would become support. We got down into that level and we ended up getting a nice entry reason in the EAP to push the market up. And we've put ourselves in a good position here. We've already hit our first targets. We have our stop loss moved to break even and we have a possibility of this being a reversal here for the dollar in pushing us all the way up to this possible resistance around 107.5 and even up to 108 or beyond. So that's what we're looking for here out of the dollar in. That's what we're hoping for. And if we get that, then around the 108 between 108 and 108.5 will be a good place to start looking for possible shorting opportunities. Of course, on the way up to that level, we do have some pretty significant levels in here around 107. We'll be taking a look at that level as well to possibly take off second targets and or for possible shorting opportunities here out of the dollar in again. We're hoping to see this market rally from this level at least up to the 108 even handle. If we don't get that though and we end up pushing down, then we'll be looking for this market to break below 105.6. If we do that, then that level will become resistance and we can use it for possible trend continuation down to 103.9 or 104 even and that level will be our possible counter trend opportunity that we look for here out of the dollar in. So those are our expectations here on this pair. We'll go ahead and move on to our next pair. Now, which is going to be the dollar Swiss. Let's go ahead and take a look at that chart now. Here on the dollar Swiss, we've now broken into trend continuation because we had this nice move last week pushing up to a high, then a pullback or one, two, three move. And now we've had a higher low plus a higher high. And in last week's predictions, we actually predicted this pretty much perfectly. So what I'm going to do is play a clip from last week's video really quickly. And then I'll be right back to share my analysis for this upcoming week here on the dollar Swiss. So let's take a look at that clip and I'll be right back. So what we can look for is a possible trading opportunity right down here at the previous level of structure support. We've already tried to capture this in the EAP training program right up here and we ended up being stopped out of that trade market as you can see pushed lower since then. But now our next spot for possible trading continuation out of this pair are not even really trading continuation. But a possible reversal trade is right here at this previous level of support. So that's what we're expecting initially out of the dollar Swiss is a push up higher from this level, at least a retest of 0.9590. And that's what we're going to be paying attention to here on this market going into this week. And that's a breakdown of the top. So guys, as you can see last week's analysis played out perfectly here owned the dollar Swiss, we had a pullback right into that level of structure talking about this previous level of support. The market found support there pushed up right to the level we expected around 0.9574. Since getting to that level, we did find a little bit of resistance there. And now since then have broken and closed above, although this was not a significant breaking close above, it still counts as a breaking close above putting us into trink continuation and giving us a long bias on this pair. So what can we look for next out of the dollar Swiss now that we had this long bias because of the sub trend? Well, for me, a nice level of structure is right in here. As you can see, the market found resistance here in the past also found support here after that initial impulsive move off of this level of support back here. So if we get a pullback into 0.952 coming into this week, then that's a level I'll be looking for possible long opportunities. And what else can we look for here on the dollar Swiss? Well, once in this up trend, I look for two separate situations. One is a pullback. And the second situation that I look for is possible trend continuation on lower time frames. So on lower time frames, we'll be looking for this market to continue upwards. If we get some kind of significant breakout above 0.9574, then of course, that level can become possible support and we'll be looking for possible trend continuation trades on lower time frames all the way up to 0.9684, which is the next place, we can look for possible short counter trend opportunities here on the dollar Swiss. So that's what we're paying attention to on this pair throughout next week, we're going to be looking for possible long trades here on the dollar Swiss. Let's go ahead and move on to our final pair of the video, which is going to be the Aussie dollar. So here on the Aussie dollar last week, we had predictions of this market coming down into 0.764. We made it right to that level. Ended up getting a nice bounce off of that level. Here we have some pretty simple analysis on this pair coming into this week. We have a obvious downtrend. We just broke below a previous level of structure coming into that major support level. What we're expecting now is a pullback either to 0.7715. That's a place we'll be looking for possible shorting opportunities out of this pair. And we could see a market that gets above that level. And if it does that, then we're looking right here at 0.7777. The reason for that is because the multiple times that this market's found support and resistance at that level. So those will be our two possible trading continuation shorting opportunity areas that we're looking for possible shorting opportunities from here at the trading channel. Also, if we get another push down into 0.7640, that's a level we can look for possible long opportunities out of this market. And below that, we can look for possible trend continuation, maybe even a pushback up to that level, all the way down to 0.7505 or right around 0.75 even for possible counter trend long opportunities based on this major level of structure looking left, along with other major levels looking left here on the Aussie dollar. And that's a breakdown of the top five major pairs guys as a breakdown of the Aussie dollar and what we're expecting out of this pair.
