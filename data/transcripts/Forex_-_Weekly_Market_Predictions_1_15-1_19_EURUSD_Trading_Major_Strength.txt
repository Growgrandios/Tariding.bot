Well you line back up that very next week and you do it all over again guys welcome to another episode of the weekly market predictions in last week's video we had five predictions on the top five major pairs four of them worked out perfectly will go over those review them and more importantly then we'll take a look at what our predictions are only top five major pairs for the coming week all

some of the intro and disclaimer role and as soon as we get back I'm gonna one go ahead and go over the trading opportunities we talked about last week that worked out really well two we'll talk about the predictions we have for this coming week so sit tight through the intro and disclaimer and I'll see you guys on the other side so this week what are we going to be paying attention to on this pair well this week we have this previous level of resistance that's been broken now we see that the market's pushing down one of our highly likely scenarios is that we pushed down around this area somewhere in this box we're creating here and we get some type of entry reason to go long possibly another week our trader said that was a clip from last week's weekly market predictions we had here on the euro dollar this market pushed down and did exactly what we expected as I said in that video there was a highly likely scenario where the market found support at previous resistance because the fact that we were entrained on this market what we're going to do is take a look at why that was our prediction so what we had was a market that ran up into a resistance level yes this was a daily resistance level but in a prediction video from a couple of weeks ago when we were looking at this level as resistance we did talk about it being a counter trend level when we're looking at a level for a counter trend trade that means we're not expecting that level to push the market down a dramatic amount what we're actually expecting is a brief retracement from that level if it's a counter trend trade as this was and first before we continue let's talk about why this was a counter level in the counter trend trade from a resistance level here the reason is because we had a market that had pushed up created a high high low high high low and high high here we have a bullish trend starting because of this bullish trend starting and the fact that we've been breaking resistance levels here on the euro dollar that means we are in an uptrend the market is likely to continue in an uptrend once it begins an uptrend so that's why we were expecting trend continuation out of this market and that's why we were also looking at this previous level of resistance to become support and push the market up if you were able to watch the video from last week and also you found an interesting reason based on your own personal trading plan on a lower time frame then congratulations because the euro dollar pushed up a very large amount from that level so that's enough about last week's predictions what are we looking at now here on the euro dollar well we are actually right at a level of resistance so this market pushed up from its previous resistance and trend continuation what do you guys think we're going to be looking for around the 1.22 9 5 level well this level is going to be a counter trend level so again we are in an uptrend here on the euro dollar and yes we're against a major level of resistance that is acted as resistance and support multiple times in the past and could possibly do so again but we're not expecting this level to push the market all the way down we're expecting it to provide the market some relief possibly people taking profit because they know it's a major level of resistance possibly people jumping in trying to sell the market from here but overall we have this uptrend in the euro dollar that we expect to continue so we're looking for a pullback here from this level we can take advantage of that pullback by trading short trades on a lower time frame because this pullback although it may not look like much here on the daily chart just as this one doesn't really like much this was over a hundred pips and on a lower time frame that can be a significant trade so not saying we can't look for short trades just saying we need to be conservative with our targets if we do from the 1.22 9 5 level regardless though this is the next level of resistance we're paying attention to for shorting opportunities and above that level if we zoom the chart out we actually have another resistance level if the market does pierce this one and go above it we can be looking for some long trades all the way up to 1.2501 which is the next level we'll look at for possible resistance now if our analysis does not play off quite as well as we expect and this level of resistance does end up being a major level which is not exactly what we expect guys but it could happen none of us know exactly what the market is going to do if this level ends up being major and pushes the market down a dramatic amount the first level of support we'll look at is 1.2063 for possible trading continuation of this market if we break below that level we'll be looking around 1.1866 as our next level of possible support to look for long opportunities out of the euro dollar so that's what we're expecting here out of the euro dollar we're going to move on now to our next pair which is a pound dollar first off we'll take a look at a clip from last week's video and then we'll explain that analysis and directly after that we'll talk about what we're expecting next from this pair now the other situation we could see this week is this market pushing down getting closer to this zone right in here that we're going to be paying attention to four long opportunities out of the pound dollar so we get down into this zone this is where we'll be looking at on the pound dollar for opportunities to go long out of this pair in trend continuation as you can see this market just now broke above a previous level of resistance and before that we broke above this period of consolidation we had back here looking left okay guys so here on the pound dollar it was a very similar situation to the euro dollar we had a market that had already broken above a period of consolidation the resistance level here came back and found support from that level right in there breaking resistance again once we did that we looked at this market as being in an uptrend now that we're in an uptrend although we were expecting counter trend moves from this resistance just like we talked about on the euro dollar we did get a counter trend move from that resistance level and we also pushed down into our previous level of structure that we were looking at for trading opportunities right in this area once we pushed down to that level we started looking for entry reasons after touching that level we ended up getting one on a lower time frame here on the pound dollar and making some pretty good profits so far out of this trade we're looking for second targets on this trade around 1.3853 now again this was a market that was in trend and we expected the trend to continue so although we're looking at this level here for second targets and possible resistance we're not going to be looking at this level for a place that's going to push the market down a tremendous amount we're looking at it as a place where the market may find some relief and then give us another opportunity to go long later on in the future after that relief so for the first level of resistance and for what we're looking for this week is possible counter trend opportunities around 1.3853 this is the first thing we're going to be looking for this week out of the pound dollar other than that if we zoom the chart out a bit and actually we don't have another level of resistance looking up so we're going to have to zoom the chart out a little bit more and we already have it pointed out here so what i'm going to do is take a horizontal line place it on this next resistance level right in there as you can see my arrows pointing out the support that this level has provided for the market meaning that it could possibly provide support and resistance again in the future so the fact that we have a level that's been tested multiple times around 1.4091 that if we break above 1.3853 will be the next level of resistance we can look at for possible counter trend shorting opportunities here on the pound dollar now as for trend continuation if we push down from here we can be looking at support around 1.3597 if we go below that we can also look for some support around 1.3441 that'll be the other level of support we look for here on the pound dollar there's our predictive analysis for this pair we'll go ahead and move on to our next pair and just like these last two first we'll take a look at a clip from last week's video we'll discuss why we had that type of analysis and how it played out and then we'll take a look at our predictions for this week so let's go ahead and head over to the dollar yen different zones the first place we're paying attention to for trading opportunities on this pair it's going to be this zone right here up top we're looking at this market traveling up to this previous level of resistance between 113 even in 113.5 pushing up to that zone giving us some kind of opportunity on a smaller time frame to take this as a short trade from this zone of resistance the dollar yen pushing down quite a lot from that level of resistance and breaking through that possible level of support we were looking at last week now this level of support was a level we were looking at for possible trading opportunities between the 112 and 11.79 level of support but something that's really important to understand is we don't just trade every single time the market touches one of these levels we're actually looking for entry reasons around these levels based on a trading plan on a lower time frame that we teach in the eap trading program so it's not like we're just placing buy orders every time the market hits a level of support we find or placing sell orders every time the market's a level of resistance we see this is just a condition we use for an entire trading plan that we have so although the market did not respect this level of support it did not count as any kind of losing trade because there was no reason to enter the market as you can see this market just pushing straight below that level of support and not even stopping to take a breath now what could we see happen next here on the dollar yen well we just pushed down breaking below support breaking below multiple support levels what does that mean what's that telling us we have this move and it probably looks familiar considering what we saw throughout this video we have a low a lower high now a lower low what is this telling us bearish trend so with a bearish trend what are we expecting trend continuation what does that mean we are at a level of support right here we're at a level where the market could definitely find support so what can we look for we can look for counter-trained opportunities but overall even though we're looking for counter-trained opportunities at 110.5 in that area we want to be conservative with those targets and if we find a counter-trained opportunity go ahead and at least have the first targets off by 111 again doesn't look like much on a smaller timeframe but that's around 50 to 100 pips that we could see this market push up so if we can get to counter-trim move from the level we're at right now around 110.5 then we may take advantage of that trade with target set at our next level of possible resistance considering this market just broke below support levels we can see some trend continuation or possible resistance out of the 111 even handle we might see this market hit the 111 even handle and push down and these are the two things we're looking for first here out of the dollar yen in this coming week now if this market gets a little more support from this level than we expect it could push all the way up to the 111.79 between that and 112 even will be the next level of possible resistance we look for in trend continuation this may be a good level to look for some trend continuation opportunities as we can see this impulsive move down that move up followed by another impulsive move down is not out of the question as for another level of support if we continue this massive move down we've had out of the dollar yen we will not be looking for long opportunities again until we hit around the 108.97 level close to the 109 even handle so that's what we're paying attention to here on the dollar yen we'll go ahead and move on to our next pair and take a look at a clip from last week's video on the dollar swiss or not that's the next level of possible resistance that we have here on the dollar swiss and another level we can look for some possible shorting opportunities from this could be a good trend continuation level as this market as we just talked about as put in a low lower high lower low this could be where we see that lower high come in right in the 0.9849 level above that if the dollar swiss giving us pretty good move down from that 0.984 level that same level we were talking about for trend continuation out of this pair and putting us into trend continuation about breaking below our previous level of support so now that we've went into trend continuation what do you guys think we're expecting next out of this pair well of course we're expecting trend continuation meaning we're expecting this market to possibly come up to this level and find some resistance and possibly not even quite make it to that level before finding resistance because of how big of a push down this was it's possible we could see a smaller retracement and then a move down but either way we are sitting around a possible level of support we could see support out of this market from this level we're not expecting a huge move up at the most we're expecting a move back up to 0.9739 if we can see that then it'll be quite a large trade on a smaller time frame so currently right now on the dollar swiss we are looking for counter-trend trading opportunities on a lower time frame around 0.9633 other than that if we get a push lower here on the dollar swiss we actually have to zoom the chart out and go ahead and point out another level of possible support i already see one let's go ahead and find a blue horse on the line place that line right here the reason we're doing that is because this level is a level of support that has acted as support multiple times in the past meaning that if the market gets down to 0.9558 we could see possible support from that level once more so there are two levels of support we're looking at the level of market is that currently for our most recent trading opportunity again going to be counter-trend trades looking for conservative targets off of this level the next level we're paying attention to is 0.9558 again will be conservative targets if the market makes it down to that level because we are in a downtrend here on the daily chart as for resistance this market pushes back up to the 0.9739 level this will definitely be a spot we'd look for possible trading continuation shorting opportunities from if we get above that we're going to look once more at 0.9845 for possible resistance as well so we'll see how that plays out throughout the week this is what we expect out of the dollar swiss this week next up we have the aussie dollar we're actually going to look at a trade we had from the aussie dollar last week as well so i'll go ahead and go to that clip and i'll see you guys on the other side dead the market continuing this big strong move the aussie dollar has had in the past couple of months pushed all the way above that level of resistance and is now starting to pull back so what do you think we're going to be waiting on this week out of the aussie dollar well upon this pullback if we can get all the way down into the 0.7819 level of previous major resistance we were looking at this is the first place where we paying attention to for trend continuation out of this pair to take some long trades from this level so if the market can pull back into that level this week we'll be looking at that area for possible long trades see if we can capture some trend continuation all the way up to the next level of resistance we have here on the aussie dollar we actually had a really nice trade in the eap training program last week on this pair i did a full video explaining that trade and the analysis behind it i'll link that video in the top right hand corner of the screen as well as in the description so we're not going to spend a ton of time on this pair considering we did a full video breaking this pair down but what i will say is this market was in an up trend the reason it was in an uptrend is because we had just broken above a previous level of resistance slash consolidation plus this level of resistance and this level of previous structure as well in our blue line after we broke above all of those levels look how impulsive this move was this entire move only had one down day only one red candle from December the 10th all the way up to the beginning of january so that's a pretty impressive rally and after a rally like that of course i'm expecting the market to continue in that direction considering we just broke a lot of resistance levels and this market just pushed up into an uptrend so considering that the first level i was looking at four possible trend continuation was right back here at this previous level of support we had around 0.7816 in this level last week is where we discussed getting a possible trading opportunity from and we actually did get a really nice trading opportunity again the full breakdown of that trade in a video that we did last week but as you can see this market ended up reacting from that level quite nicely based on what we said in last week's weekly market predictions video now what are we expecting in the future out of the aussie dollar well considering where we are right now what we're actually expecting we could see a brief little pullback but we do think this market's going to hit the 0.8023 level at some point either this week or next week because of that we're going to be looking on smaller time frames for trend continuation out of this pair all the way up to that level so that's initially what we're looking for and then if we get to the 0.8023 level we can look for counter trend opportunities remember that's going to be with some conservative targets that counter trend opportunity at 0.8023 and if the market pushes above that which isn't likely this week but possible we're looking around the 0.8117 level for next level of possible resistance if the market pushes down from here we're still expecting trend continuation out of this pair especially if we get all the way down to 0.7893 that'll be a great level to look for some trading continuation opportunities if the market as a push down if we get below that level the next level support we'll be looking at is around the 0.7816 level the same level we took a trading opportunity off of this week so guys that's a breakdown of the aussie dollar that's a breakdown of the top five major pairs hopefully this information
