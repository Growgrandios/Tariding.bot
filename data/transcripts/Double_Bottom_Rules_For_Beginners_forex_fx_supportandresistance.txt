And the way I define double bottoms is very simple. I put a box between the bodies and the swing low as in between the bodies and the wick of that swing low. And this is the termination point for my double bottom. What I mean by that is prices must touch this area. I must have at least a wick in this area. I can also see a candle close in this area. I can also see a wick come past this area. But those are the only things I can see. What I cannot see is a wick not touch this area. Something like this would not be a double bottom for me. And I also cannot see the body of a candle close below that previous low because this would say trend continuation to the downside. And if I'm looking to buy, I don't want to see trend continuation to the downside.
