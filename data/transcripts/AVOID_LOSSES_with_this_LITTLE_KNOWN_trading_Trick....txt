What is up and welcome to today's video in today's video I'm gonna solve a problem for you that I've seen so many traders have I've had so many questions about and that is how do I avoid? Entering a trade at the end of a trend and then getting stopped out So for example, take a look at the chart on the screen What if you are looking at this market as in a trend it is definitely in a trend you can see that by looking at it and The markets pushing down pushing down break support and you go okay. We now have a trending market I want to sell this market and you sell the market at previous support because that should become resistance So you go ahead and put a limit order at previous support to sell Expecting trend continuation in this market to push down you put a stop loss above previous resistance pretty good place for a stop and then You're super excited because you think you're gonna win the trade But the market does something like this and stops you out and then reverses and continues higher The question is is there a way to avoid this situation and the answer to that is no Not completely there's no way to never get caught in a situation like this But there is a way to minimize the amount of times you get caught in this type of situation And what I'm gonna show you today is two ways that I use to minimize the amount of times I am caught in situations like this so what I'm gonna teach you is how to know when the market's going to reverse trend and also a way you can use to Actually capture more profits when the market is trending a way you can get out of the market based on the fact that you know The market may soon reverse So that sounds interesting make sure you click that subscribe button below the video to the right hand side Click that like button for me follow us on the socials now be right back with today's content after the intro and disclaimer. See you soon So what is the first way of avoiding Reversing situations in the market when you're trying to trade train continuation That's what we're talking about right now Way number one is so simple that I can explain it to you in one sentence But I'm also gonna go through the market and actually show you an example of this in this one way I'm gonna show you now would have completely avoided the trade the loss that we looked at before the intro and disclaimer It's again so simple. I can explain it in the sentence avoid trading trend continuation trades when the market touches a previous level of daily structure So that was the very simple way of explaining it what I'm gonna do now We show you a very nice example of how that would have kept you out of losing a euro Aussie trade trying to trade Trinking in relation when the market's bouncing off of a level of support We're trading in the downward direction in this case bearish. So let's go ahead and grab our market replay tool and For example sake, let's say you are trading Pullback strategies on a four-hour time frame. You're waiting for a pullback and a shooting star candle Don't go out and trade the strategy you can go out and test it and see if it works out for you I've not tested it I'm just using this as a very simple example But what I would do first if I looked right here at the euro Aussie and I saw that this market had just put it a nice one two three move I go okay one two three we have impulsive move followed by pullback followed by another impulsive move We're now in a bearish trend with that being the case I want to trade bearish trend continuation trades But the first thing I would do once I see this market is in a bearish trend is I would jump out from the four-hour To a daily chart I would look left on this daily chart and I would go okay since we've just broken below our previous support Now I'm waiting to see where the next level of support is because I don't want to trade if the market touches that in the bearish direction As you can see right here is the next level of support I'm just looking at the most previous level of support So this is the most previous level of support that being the case I would place a horizontal line there I would jump back over to the four-hour chart remember our strategy waiting for pullbacks and a shooting star candle so At this point we're gonna move the chart forward and we get a pullback shooting star candle that red candle right there Would have been our entry you can play stops and targets however you would like to let's say above the entry candle We move forward. We don't get stopped out the market Eventually continues down now We're waiting for the same exact thing again because we have not hit our horizontal line We haven't hit that daily level of structure support yet So we're still waiting on our strategy which for a very simple example in this case is a pullback and a shooting star candle And we pull back up Eventually get a shooting star candle right there that red candle so now we're short with a stop above that candle Don't get stopped out the market continues in trend. Oh, what about now now? We've hit that black line that we looked at on the daily chart Okay, so in this case the market has just hit a previously tested major level of structure support with that being the case Do you want to trade trend continuation on the Eurowazi? I hope your answer was no you don't want to be trading trend continuation when the market is just hit a daily level of structure of any kind so To help you really understand this if this market on the four-hour chart would not have we've already seen it We know it breaks up and start to start to trend to the upside If it had not done that and continued to push down and broke below this level What do you think I would do I would be then looking left after the breaking closed below this level? I would be looking left and I would ask myself looking left Where's the next most previous levels of structure support that have been tested? So if we look left? The levels I would look at right here is a level of support and right here is a major level of support Those two levels are the levels I would avoid trading trend continuation to the downside at so if this market pushed down I would trade smaller timeframe one hour 15 minute maybe even four hour depending on what kind of targets I could get down to 1.582, but I would trade trade continuation only until we hit this level once we hit this level I want to see how the market reacts the market starts heading higher Obviously the downtrend is over based on that analysis if the market breaks through that level and continues lower then I would trade All the way down to my next level of support I would continue trading if we did this and we had this situation I would trade little breakout patterns or pullback patterns whatever it is all the way down to 1.5702 and this Again, there's no way to never be caught in a situation where the market is Reversing you will be calling that every now and then but this is one of the ways that will minimize The amount of times that you get caught in a market reversing while you're trying to trade trend continuation And it's so simple it will take you less than five minutes to look at a higher time frame like a daily chart whenever you're looking for your trend continuation trades on smaller time frames and ask yourself Where's the most previous level of structure that I need to be looking at to avoid trend continuation? That's all you have to do for way number one and this will actually increase your accuracy on trend continuation trading a Dramatic amount is something that really helped me increase the accuracy of my own personal trend continuation trades So that's way number one now. Let's jump into way number two Okay, welcome to part number two Hopefully that first part was really helpful to you if it was make sure to smash that like button for me and leave me a comment Also, if you found that to be interesting We actually have a link below for a free reversal strategy that uses the same exact concept You just learned to actually capture reversals in the market That's gonna be free for the next seven days only so if you want to check that out The link is in the description Just click that head over there put in your email address and I will send you the full course via email Otherwise, we're gonna jump into the second part. So what's the second way to avoid? trend continuation whenever the markets likely to reverse and Also, this is one of my favorite ways to take targets own trend continuation trades What I'm gonna do first is head up to a whiteboard and show you this extremely simple process again This is also extremely extremely simple What I'm looking for is let's say the markets in an uptrend and I decide I'm gonna trade trend continuation based off a bounce off the Previous level of structure resistance I get my entry reason there and I place the trade if I'm gonna trade trend Continuation trend following that I'm gonna continue to hold that position Until I think the markets going to reverse with that being the case what I what I normally do is move my stop Loss up to previous levels of support as we break through resistance levels. So after this break This would be the support level I would continue to do that after every break move my stop loss to the previous support level to below it And what I would be waiting on is a situation again moving stop loss here would be a situation where the market is pushing up But then creates a one two three move to the downside and my rules for this as I need two candles coming down a two candle pullback right here and then the break below and close below the low of that pullback is where I will take My position off so if we had a candle that looked like this and closed below the previous level on my one two three move Then I would take targets off here instead of waiting on my trail stop to be hit So it saves me this many pips it gets me this many more pips however many this would be in this specific situation and now I've been able to take off targets at a higher point giving me more profits So this is a way to actually capture more profits in a trend continuation trend following type trade if you're already in the trade and you want to take profits off a little bit earlier Still giving yourself a reason to actually exit the trade and get putting you in a good position to know when the market's going to Reverse because a situation where a market's heading higher and then you see something like this This right here is a situation where the market is likely to reverse That's one two three move to the downside puts us in something called a bearish rotation in an uptrend and a downtrend This is called a bullish rotation. What I'm gonna do is take you to a chart So you can better understand this give you a better example of how all of this works. So in this case Right here on the Aussie New Zealand. We have a market that's pushing up Let's say we start breaking resistance levels here We have our pullback and we have another push up breaking resistance and this pullback and push up could go either way It could go like this. Let's say it goes like that And I say I want to trade when the market gets back down to the previous resistance level I'm gonna have a limit order there and I'm gonna be ready to take this market up for trend following So the market pushes down hits my limit order right here that being the case I would go ahead place my order here And I would have a stop loss below the previous support level and then as the market pushed forward as we break above resistance levels I would then move my stop loss up to follow that trend So if the market does something like this once we break this resistance level I move my stop loss up and when we break this resistance level which we do very soon like right here Once we break that resistance level, I would move my stop loss up again So there's my stop loss and then we have another level of resistance right here that was broken So I would move my stop loss up to this support level right here and with this being the case Here's my stop loss for now What I'm waiting on is the market to do a one two three move Remember two candles down at least follow by at least two candles back up and the candle that closes below The low of my pullback is where I'm gonna exit the trade in a trend following situation So as we do that you can see that right here this little red candle actually does close below My previous level of support in my one two three move so my target would have been taken Right here and you'll see what this does as the market pushes down It would have stopped me out on trail stops But instead I captured this many more pips by having this very specific way of noticing when the market is likely to reverse trend So this is one of the ways again that I like to use in order to take profits But at the same time this also tells me that I don't want to look for trink continuation trades If the market has just put in this one two three move so that avoids that and let's just check this with an actual position tool This would have been our position we would add a stop loss initially below the support level over here and our initial target We really don't have a target. We're using trail stops So we go from being stopped out at about a one-to-one risk reward to a 1.5 risk reward adding 0.5 margin to our risk reward just by taking targets off in this specific way using this one two three pattern and again That's one of the ways that I use in order to avoid taking trend continuation trades once I see that one two three move I may say no, I'm not trading in trink continuation style anymore based on that one two three move So hopefully that's been valuable to you take these and test them out in the markets and see if they actually give you an edge Do it yourself don't just take my word for it Is this something I do use in my trading and it does help me avoid Situations where I shouldn't be trading with the trend in situations where I have a one two three move or situations where I'm hitting a daily level of structure It's definitely something you have to go test everything I show you in these videos is something that I know is Testable and verifiable and the reason for that is because you need to do that testing So be sure to do that if you did enjoy the video again click that like button to get your hands on that free training listed below It's a free reversal strategy.
