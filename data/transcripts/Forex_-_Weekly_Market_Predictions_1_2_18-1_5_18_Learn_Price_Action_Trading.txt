In today's video, we're going to start off on the most popular forex pair. Here on the euro dollar, we're actually floating around resistance level and just to recap a little bit about 2018, let's take a look at why we were interested in this level at 1.2060 in the first place. So I'm going to zoom the chart out and guys excuse these arrows you see down here. I did a little back testing throughout Christmas and New Year's break and I still haven't had time to transfer that over into a spreadsheet to see how it's played out. And that's why you're going to probably see a few arrows on my screen for a couple of pairs in today's video. So just excuse the arrows as we go through today's video and back on topic here around that same 1.2060 level, we had the standalone level of support looking left on the euro dollar. That level proved to be extremely important. As you can see from that level and we'll zoom down to see this a little bit clearer. But from that level, we've had a really nice push down of a few hundred pips here on the euro dollar. So the next level we're paying attention to has been support in the past right in through here and has also been support right here and right here. This level acting as a head and shoulders pattern is the support level right in there as the shoulders. So that's the reason we're paying attention to that next level up. What we actually have to do is find a new level of resistance up here for the euro dollar. So we'll just go over here. That's where we're going to find this resistance level. We'll start looking around. What do you guys see? You guys see anywhere that we could look at as a potential level of structure that the market could respect based on what we see in the past. And what we're really looking for is a level in the market that's been respected multiple times. But I can go ahead and tell you there is a level that's been respected multiple times right here. Do you guys see that? This level has not only been respected to support in the past but also has resistance twice as well. Meaning that's the next level of resistance. We're going to be paying attention to here on the euro dollar. So let's zoom the chart back down so we can actually see something. And now we'll go ahead and turn this line to blue since the market is above it. It's going to become support. We have a resistance level. The market is at right now. This level could act as resistance. We could see a push down from the 1.2060 level just as we have in the past. As you can see the market pushing down quite dramatically from that level before. So it's quite possible that we could see a push down from this level. Now what if that doesn't happen? What if we end up getting a little break above? Well, if that's the case we have a long ways to go. We have a nice opportunity to take some long trades all the way up to 1.23 even around 1.2299 or 1.23 even as the next place we'll be taking a look at for shorting opportunities at that point it will be counter-trend shorting opportunities. Right now market yes in an uptrend you could say but overall in a period of consolidation here on the euro dollar. So that's what we're looking at when it comes to resistance. What are we looking at whenever it comes to support? Well if the market pulls back down this level in here seems to have been respected multiple times as you can see resistance support support resistance consolidation in the area resistance again and then the market broke above it. Well now that since that's the case we can look really around this resistance level all the way from there down to the 1.18 for five level. This is a pretty big zone but this is really where the market could turn around and go back up if we get a pullback here. So that's a zone of support we're going to be paying attention to. Now other than that if we break through that zone we have a little small ways down until our next support level which is actually going to have to be moved up a little bit. The support level now is going to come up to the weeks of these candles making it around 1.1714 here on the euro dollar. So if we get that push down we were talking about 1.1714 the next level will be paying attention to for long opportunities on the euro dollar and that's what we're paying attention to on this pair for this first week in 2018. First off we're taking a look here where the market is right now around 1.2060 we're going to be paying attention on lower time price to see if we can get a shorting opportunity from this level. Yes it will be counter trends especially on lower time frames so that's something you want to look out for and pay attention to but we are at a major level of structure on this pair that has been resistance in the past. So that's exactly what we're looking at here on the euro dollar. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. Okay guys so the next pair is going to be the pound dollar. Here we are on that daily chart and very similar to the euro dollar we're actually floating around a level of resistance that's been used to push the market around in the past. Actually got a really dramatic push down from this level in the past of almost 600 pips so knowing that this level has acted as resistance in the past multiple times gives us a hint that it could do the same now. So as for the immediate future just like on the euro dollar we're going to be paying attention to this level around 1.3597 as a possible level of resistance. Something we also have to do just like on the euro dollar pair is turn this 1.341 level into support. So we're going to change that into blue because the market did break above it meaning that if the market pulls back that level will now be possibly acting as support and below that for support we have the 1.33 all the way down to 1.32 this zone of consolidation we've been paying attention to over the past few weeks for support. We actually had a pretty good trade off of right back in here and those levels guys are pretty far away so probably not going to do that throughout the first week here in 2018 but something we could possibly see is a trade off of this resistance level that could push the market down and also we have the opportunity to look out for some kind of breakout of this level as well where the market pushes up above this level and gives us some long opportunities all the way up to the 1.3853 level which is going to be the next level of resistance after the one we're looking at right now on the pound dollar. So that is what we're going to be paying attention to as for the immediate future here on the pound dollar. The next pair we'll do now is the zone is the dollar in. So guys here on the dollar in the first thing I want to pay attention to is this very impressive period of consolidation. So we've had about a 700-pip period of consolidation in this market since the beginning of 2017 that full year where we started around 115 even and the lowest we got was somewhere around 108 even of course we got a little bit lower than that with this canowick but 108 even is what we're going to count it as this 700-pip period of consolidation is what the market respected throughout the entire year of 2017. So I thought that was pretty impressive and just wanted to point that out to you guys. Now as for the immediate future we are floating right above a possible level of support here on the dollar in. This is a level that's actually a support in the past as you can see here and resistance here along with support resistance here again here and here. So definitely the level of the market is respected multiple times and that we could possibly see the market respect yet again probably sometime this week. We could see that much of a move within this week. So as for the immediate future that's what we're looking at here on the dollar in and if we're looking for the market to get there what do you think we can look for right now on this chart. Well we can actually look for possible shorting trades down to that level if we're day trading so that's another thing we can look out for in the immediate future. Below that level if the market does break below that possible level of support at around 111.79 then we can look again here at the 111 even handle as a possible level of support and below that at 110.47. So that is the levels of support that we're paying attention to on the dollar in. What about resistance? Well as a new resistance level we're actually going to be paying attention right around in here at the 113.5 and this is actually a level of resistance that we have paid attention to before in the past and we've also taken a look here at the 113 even handle and guys there's so many levels looking back in the past because this market consolidated throughout the entire year of 2017 that just about anywhere this market goes it could see possible resistance so we are going to be paying attention around the 113 even handle. We are also going to wait for the 113.5 area to be possible resistance and above that these previous major resistance levels this is the big area that we're going to be paying attention to if the market gets up here we have a really high likelihood that the market's going to respect the 114.23 area well between 114 even in 114.23 again that is the big zone that we'll be paying attention to most definitely if the market reaches it but until then we do have 113 even and 113.5 to pay attention to to possibly stop this market as resistance on the way up if we get some type of rally out of the dollar yet. You got some sorry I think I'm losing my voice a little bit I'm a huge college football fan and UGA my favorite college team actually made it to the national championship last night by winning the Rose Bowl so my voice is probably going to crack a little bit throughout this video but let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. Next pair is the dollar Swiss here on the dollar Swiss we have a pair that is currently floating around a previous level of structure that could in fact be used to push this market up to give us a rally out of the dollar Swiss now there's a couple of different things that could actually happen at this level we could see this market rally up from here we're already below that level though here on the daily timeframe if we get a close down here below this level then we could possibly see this level act as resistance and push the market down so we'll be waiting on the close of this candle to figure out what we really want to do at this point on the dollar Swiss what we'll be looking for is if this market can push back up close that candle above 0.9740 then we'll be looking at this level as support and looking to take long opportunities off of this level if not if we close down here below the 0.9740 level then we'll be looking for this market to rally back up into that level for resistance and push the market down that's what we're looking for in the immediate future here on the dollar Swiss what could happen if this market continued to push down we'll if we continue to push down then the next level we'll be looking at for support is going to be around 0.9633 and s4 resistance we actually have to go ahead and change the color of the 0.9853 line right here we're going to change this to red because the market is now below this level meaning that it could now act as resistance instead of support so we'll be waiting for this market to get a rally if we do get a rally then we'll be waiting for the 0.9849 level before we look for any type of shorting opportunity out of this pair that's a level that's acted as support resistance support in the past along with support back here resistance right in here so again a level in the market that's acted as both support and resistance multiple times after that we'll be looking up here at 0.9945 this area that's acted as resistance and support in the past as another possible area for resistance out of the dollar Swiss now we'll go ahead and move on to our final pair in the video which is going to be the Aussie dollar that's what we're paying attention to on the dollar Swiss let's go ahead and head over to that Aussie dollar chart and take a look at what we're expecting out of that pair throughout the first week in 2018 so here on the Aussie dollar something we need to pay attention to is the fact that we have just reverse direction as you can see from this level of support down here around the 0.75 even handle we got a huge rally out of this market breaking above one resistance two resistance and now floating around a previous resistance level could we get a possible counter-trading opportunity from this level that could push the market down well the answer to that is of course we could this is a very strong level of structure on the Aussie dollar we have it acting as resistance and support multiple times in the past that kind of looks like a face but anyway this market could see resistance out of 0.7819 area if we do get some resistance out of this area we'll be a counter-trin trade with this big impulsive move up as i said we did reverse train and what's important to remember about counter-trin trades is we're not looking for this area to just push the market all the way back down to this previous support level what we'll be looking for is some type of small move here on daily chart that we can take advantage of on a smaller time frame from here and possibly get some good profits on a smaller time frame with minimal risk now what could happen if the market breaks above this level if we go above 0.7819 we could possibly look for long opportunities all the way up to 0.7893 somewhere around the 0.79 even handle is the next level of resistance we'll be paying attention to here on the Aussie dollar and if we do get that pushed down we could possibly see from 0.7819 area we can look for shorting opportunities all the way down to 0.7730 that'll be the first level of support we look for unless we can get some type of different entry reason considering that this market's been in such a strong up move we may not make it all the way back down to this level on a pullback we may see something like this and then the market continue upwards so we'll just kind of play that by ear and see what happens but as for major levels of support we are looking around the 0.7730 area below that we'll be looking around the 0.7653 area for major support here on the Aussie dollar so that's what we're paying attention to on the Aussie dollar and that's what we're paying attention to on the top five major pairs when it comes to trading opportunities throughout the first week here in 2018
