Hey everyone, Steven here from the Trading Channel and today's video is going to be a little bit different. Today we're not going to be looking at very many charts. Instead, we are going to look at how I set up my spreadsheet for back testing and for live trading. Last week I did a video and in that video I asked that anyone who was interested in seeing a tutorial on how I set up my spreadsheets for back testing and for live trading to leave a comment under that video. But I had a number of traders that left comments saying they would be interested in seeing a video like this. So do all of you that left comments for me. I want to say thank you. I do appreciate it and keep those comments coming. I will be explaining this trade here on the euro dollar to begin with as soon as we get back from the intro and disclaimer. So I'll let those two things roll and I will see you on the other side. Alright, so before I get started analyzing the euro dollar here on the chart in front of you, I have a quick question for you guys. I'm in the process of making a trader education website and on this website I plan to have a course that is much more affordable than other courses I've seen and I would also like to incorporate either a live room, a live trading room or a mentor program and I'm interested to know which one of those two things if you were in the market for a trader education website, you would be more interested in seeing. So the mentor program would consist of a nightly video that I would email to clients doing market analysis and showing them exactly what I see in the markets every night. So the clients would have access to my personal email and a few phone calls a month for any questions they may have. Also maybe some live training through Skype and the live trading room would just be clients watching me day trade throughout the day and asking any questions they might have through chat. So if you were looking around for a trading education website, which one of those two things would you be more interested in seeing? If you don't mind just leave me a comment below the video telling me which one. I would appreciate that and it would be extremely helpful. So here on the euro dollar, if I zoom the chart out a bit, we can see that we are in an uptrend and that we have recently broke out of a channel and just took off like a rocket from there. Now what I do when I see an uptrend is automatically thank how can I get involved with the trend with a minimum stop loss. And the best way I've found to do that is waiting for a breaking close above a previous structure level. And if you've seen some of my other videos, this is going to look all too familiar. There's our breaking close right here. And now after that breaking close above, we wait for a retracement back down into, if you've seen my other videos, what are we waiting for? If you said 786 retracement, then you are correct. We pull from our swing low up to the swing high. Wait for the 786 retracement where our limit orders are sitting. We put targets back up at previous structure here and we put stop losses below the previous swing low here. As you can see, our stops are sitting below that. Our targets are up here at previous structure. And we've actually got close enough now to targets to be able to roll our stops to rake even. Like that. We're going to be getting ourselves in a risk free trade. And hopefully price action will keep going up and eventually hit our targets here. So with that, we will go ahead and go over to the spreadsheets and I'll start explaining to you how I set up my spreadsheets for back testing, forward testing and live trading. So before we get started, I do want to reiterate that this is not going to be like my other videos. If you are interested in seeing something like my other videos where you see multiple examples of strategies that I use in the market, then I suggest that you go over to my channel and check out a few of those videos if you haven't seen them yet. From here on out in this tutorial, we will mostly be talking about spreadsheets and how I use them to determine how to trade a strategy in the market. So this is my 786 trend continuation strategy back testing template. This is the actual template I use when I'm back testing the 786 trend continuation strategy that I teach on my YouTube channel. If you would like to see that tutorial, I'll post a link in the bottom left hand side of your screen. And this is the way most of my back testing spreadsheets are set up. Always record the date of every trade. Always record a number of different targets that I'd like to test for. I'll also record a number of different stop losses I'd like to test for and whether the trade won or lost. And also, I record any other information I may like to know about the strategy for instance in this specific strategy. I test if after hitting entry, we come up to a 618 and I roll my stops to break even. Does that make this strategy perform better or worse? So as a special thank you to the people who commented under the previous video I did say and they wanted to see a video like this and thank you to everyone that's viewing this and who subscribed to my channel, I'm going to show you my actual back testing results for this strategy on the New Zealand dollar that I just finished with a couple of days ago. Now before we take a look at those back testing results, understand this clearly. Full disclaimer, past performance does not dictate future results. I see the market completely different than you will and just because my results are profitable, that does not mean that your results will be the same. It is very important for you to back test these strategies that I teach here on my channel for yourself to decide whether or not you are comfortable trading them in any market. So with that said, we'll go ahead and go over to my back testing results for the New Zealand dollar and I'll let you take a look at how that performed in the markets the way I trade it. Here we are over on the New Zealand dollar spreadsheet and now is when I will explain a little bit about the numbers. This is the part of the spreadsheet that will tell you how you are going to trade this strategy once you're finished back testing it. This will give you all the results of the different factors that you've tested for. So for instance, for the 786 targets, meaning this column here, for every time that I took a target at the 786 retracement, I record that information in this box. And with the 786 targets with the stops rolled to a 618 retracement, as I was talking about earlier, that information is recorded here. Now taking structure targets, this column here is recorded in this box and same as here whenever we roll the stops to a 618 retracement, that's recorded in this box. On this pair, I tested three years of data from February of 2013 down to February of 2016 this year. Throughout that time, trading the 786 strategy with structure targets, I was able to produce 1,505 pips in that amount of time. My average loss was 48.61 pips. My average win was 81 pips, giving me a risk to reward of 1.67. I won 49 trades, lost 51 trades, and my win percentage was 49% over that amount of time. Now if we take a minute and compare all of these numbers, you will see that the best way for me to trade this strategy, according to all the information that I recorded, would be to trade with structure targets and rolling stops to break even once I hit a 618 retracement. The reason that's going to be the best strategy for me is because that is where the most pips were made. And also, my win percentage here is a bit higher than if I were to just take structure trades and not roll my stops after hitting a 618 retracement. I have the same risk to reward, a better win percentage, and I win more pips trading with the structure target and rolling my stops to break even after a 618 retracement. The only reason I know this information is because of all the testing I did. So doing that back testing is the only way you will ever figure out the best way to trade the specific strategy that you are testing. Now as you can see, we had a better win percentage here with the 786 strategy, rolling stops at a 0.618, but we only had about 1% better of a win percentage as you can see and we were about 250 less pips altogether. So to me, it's worth it to sacrifice that 1% of win percentage for an extra 250 pips overall. That's why I've decided to trade like this. Now I'll go back over to the blank spreadsheet and show you exactly how to enter these numbers and the formulas used in order to determine this information you see in the numbers section of the spreadsheet. Here we are back on the blank spreadsheet and as I said before, you can type in any number of different targets you'd like to test, any number of stop losses, and any number of other factors that you'd like to test while testing these strategies. I've already tested a number of different pairs using this strategy so I know what stop loss I like the best for my specific trading style and the targets that I want to test for as well. So if we look over here at the number section, I'm going to teach this as if I was teaching someone that was not familiar at all with using spreadsheets in order to calculate trading results. So if it seems a bit slow, I do apologize, but when I was first starting to trade, there was no video out there like this that was explaining how I could use a spreadsheet in order to determine back testing results. So here in the number section, I just have a few things that I'd like to look at when I'm testing a strategy. The amount of pips that I've made throughout the course of time that I test, the average loss throughout that course of time, the average win which will give me my average risk to reward, the number of wins and losses which will give me my win percentage, and maybe even the amount of money that I would have made. So I've tried to find a strategy that I've made throughout that historic data. So what I'll do now is just paste in a few numbers from our New Zealand spreadsheet here. And now that we have our back testing information, all we would do is transfer that over to pips per trade in each section that it applies to. So for the 786 targets, make a section for that specific target and you'll have to do this for every difference type of targets and stops that you have. I only have one type of stop loss, so I don't have to do multiple sections for that. I do have multiple targets. I have a target set at a 786 retracement after entry and a target set at structure after entry. So for that reason, I need two different sections of testable data. And what I do is just transfer the pips made or loss per trade into a section in this section of data. So here, the pips per trade on the first trade on 416 13. As you can see here, the trade lost, I have two Ls here, meaning I lost the 786 target and also lost trying to get targets at structure. So with that being a loss, obviously we would type in the stop loss, which was minus 50. If we just go down the list, minus 45, minus 45. And here we had a win on 512 13. We had a win of the 786 target, which is what we're looking for. So on the 786 target, if we come to our 786 target column, we see that we won 54 pips and we just type in 54 pips. Now I'll go ahead and type in the rest of these numbers and I'll be right back to share with you the formulas that I use in order to calculate the information in this smaller box here. So now that we have the pips per trade on the 786 target trades, we can actually start to record the information that's going to help us to determine how we want to trade the strategy once we take it to a live market. In order to do this, we use functions that come with any spreadsheet program. Now in order to calculate the pips, you could go down through here with a calculator or in your head and just add negative 50 plus negative 45 plus negative 45 plus 54. And that is a long and grueling process that no one should have to do. If you can just find your functions key, which should be somewhere on any spreadsheet type program like Excel on LibreOffice, which is what I use, the functions tab is right here. So I will click on the functions tab and I have all here what I'm looking for. If I'm wanting to know the amount of pips that I made for this strategy is I'm looking for the sum of all these numbers. So what I'll do is come down here, find the S's in the functions, double click sum and the numbers that I want to add, all I have to do is click and drag throughout those numbers and then hit enter. That will give me the sum of all these numbers and the total amount of pips made for this specific strategy. Now the average loss, the way you would have to do that is go down through here and take every loss minus 50 minus 45 minus 45 minus 55. Obviously every number with a negative sign in front of it, add them all together and then divide them by the amount of trades that were losers. Instead of doing all that, there is a very handy function called average if on every spreadsheet program. So we find that function, average if, double click it. The range is going to be the numbers that you want to average. So we'd like to average these numbers. The criteria is which of these numbers do you want to average. So really what we're saying is we want to average these numbers with the range, we want to average these numbers and this is the if statement. If you've ever read anything about coding, you would know that most codes are put in a format of if then. So this is going to be the range of numbers and if these numbers are less than zero, then we want to average them and always make sure to put quotations at the beginning and end of your criteria, otherwise this will not work. So average if this range of numbers is less than zero and that gives us our average loss. So our average loss is 44.14 pips. For the average when, we do the same exact thing but the opposite. So we take our average if, give it the range of numbers we'd like to average and we would only like to average these numbers if quotations, they are greater than zero. This gives us an average win of 70.38. Now the amount of wins we could go down through here and it would be quite easy to do if we only had 35 trades as we do here but it gets a little more complicated when you test 200 trades. So an easier way to do that is by finding the count if function on your spreadsheet program. Count if, double click. Again, we want this range of numbers and we would like to count them if they are greater than zero because we're looking for wins. Quotations greater than zero. Enter. That gives us 21 wins and now for the losses we do the same thing. Count if the range of numbers is here. We want to count them if they are less than zero. So quotations, less than sign, zero and enter. 14. So we know that we had 21 wins and 14 losses over this period of time using this strategy. The way we would determine our winning percentage is by taking our wins and dividing them by the total number of trades. An easy way to do that with our spreadsheet is by giving it a problem to solve. The way we give it a problem to solve is by clicking the equals button. Just let the program know that you want it to solve a problem. So if I were to do equals two times two, click enter, it would give me four. We don't want to know two times two. We would like to know what our wins divided by our total number of trades, which will be the wins and the losses together. Wins plus losses equals. So then we hit enter. Then we see that we have .6 if we convert that to a percentage using our format as percent button up top here. We see that we have a 60% win rate for this period of time using this specific strategy. And for the risk to reward, again, we would like the program to solve a problem for us. So we click the equals button. And what we want to know is our average risk to reward, which would be our average win divided by our average loss. That gives us a 1.59. We'll convert that to the two closest decimal points. And that will equal 1.59. So there will be other factors you will want to know about a trading strategy once you have tested multiple pairs and actually put them into an entire strategy. For instance, you may want to know the max number of losses that you can have, the max number of wins, the drawdown. And there are also codes that you can use in order to perform those kind of functions. And I'll be going over those codes in a later video. This one is running a bit long, so I may not have time for that today. But as you can see here, we have the cash amount that we would make or lose in the strategy that we tested over this amount of time. In order to determine that, what I do when back testing, I'm not necessarily looking for exact results. So I know that for instance, if I was testing for a $10,000 account, I would not know that I would probably be trading about a $20,000 unit position size in a $10,000 account. That's just what my risk tolerance allows for. Yours is going to be completely different. But if I'm trading a $20,000 unit position size, then I know that for each pip, I make and lose $2. So if I'm making and losing $2 for each pip, all I have to do is give the system a problem to solve with the equals tab. And the problem I want it to solve is my number of pips times the dollar amount I will make and lose per pip, which is going to be somewhere around $2 if I'm trading a $20,000 unit position size. So times two, enter. That would be $1720 that I would have made throughout this time using this specific strategy. Alright guys, so as I said, before this video is getting a little bit long, it's rocking on about 25 minutes now. And I do not like to do YouTube videos longer than 25 minutes because a lot of people don't have the time to sit in front of the computer and watch a video for 30 minutes during the day. So for that reason, I'm going to end the video here and just do a follow up video explaining how I set up my spreadsheets for live trading and also going over the spreadsheet and equity curve that I have for the account that I trade here on my YouTube channel. So if you're subscribed, you will be alerted by email when that video comes out. If you're not subscribed, go ahead and do that so that you're alerted whenever it comes out as well. And thank you guys for watching. If you enjoyed this video, be sure to click that like button for me and leave a comment with any questions you might have. Before I let you go, I'm going to show you the results of the 786 trade that we were looking at at the beginning of this video. Good luck trading in the markets this week and I'll talk to you soon. And back on the Euro Dollar trade here that we were taking a look at before we started the spreadsheet video, I just wanted to show you guys the progress we've made on this trade and we are getting pretty close to targets now. We've made it all the way up to about 8 pips below our initial target. So hopefully we can roll on up here and hit targets. I'll keep you updated on this trade as it plays out. So back over here on the Euro Dollar 786 trade, as you can see, we have actually hit targets on this trade for if I bring it on my ruler somewhere around 107 pips of profit. That was a great example of a successful 786 strategy trade. If that's a strategy that you would like to learn, then I have a tutorial for it on my YouTube channel. So definitely go check that out by clicking the link that is in the bottom left hand side of your screen. Thanks for watching. Don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time.
