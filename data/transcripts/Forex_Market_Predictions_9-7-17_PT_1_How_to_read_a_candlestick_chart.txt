Hey traders and welcome to another 4X market predictions video. In these videos we go through the market and point out key levels of structure on the top 5 major pairs that we'll be paying attention to for trading opportunities. If you're someone who is new to trading or someone that just does not believe that structure has a vital role in where the market goes and how it moves then I would suggest that you stick around through the entirety of this short video. Most of our predictions from last week's video ended up coming true based around these structure levels from last week's structure based trading market predictions video. And after that we'll also be going through the market and pointing out the key levels of structure that we're going to be paying attention to for trading opportunities. These are key levels that we expect the market to either reverse or go into trend continuation from. So if you're interested in knowing the levels of structure we'll be looking for trading opportunities at here at the trading channel then make sure to stick around through the intro and disclaimer.

So here we are on the euro dollar and last week we had predictions that told us that this market would possibly make it from where we were. Last week's video we had just gapped up. We were floating around in this area and the predictions that we pointed out based on our analysis here at the trading channel is that this market would push up to our 1.204 non-level and we'd also be looking for trading opportunities if we pulled back into this daily zone. We did both of those things and we ended up getting trading opportunities in both of these areas. Also in last week's video we pointed this level out as a counter-trend trading opportunity meaning that we were looking for short trades right here back down into this previous daily level of structure. So hopefully for those of you who are newer to trading or for those of you who don't really believe in structure very much it's starting to become more clear that leads levels can help us predict market moves. And what I'm going to do is play you guys a clip from last week's video where we were pointing all of this out and then I'll be right back after that quick clip. About 100 pips away from where the market is right now. What I'm going to be looking at throughout the rest of the week for the euro dollar is actually some long opportunities. I'm going to be looking to try to get long to the 1.2049 level. So let's go ahead and drop down to a smaller time frame quickly before we discuss these other levels and talk about how we can actually take advantage of this. Here we are on a 4 hour chart guys and something I'll be looking for. This week is actually a pullback into this zone here. So here we have a 4 hour level of structure back here that lines up really nicely with our daily major structure level. So if the market pulls back into this area that's where I'll be looking for some type of long opportunity here on the euro dollar. Now there's also a situation where this market does not pull back at all and just continues to rise and in that case we can look for some other types of trades down on smaller time frames in order to get involved long up to that level at the 1.2049 zone. And of course if the market does just go straight up to that level then we'll be looking for counter trends shorting opportunities from that zone. So in that clip you can see that in last week's video we were predicting that this market would make it up to the 1.2049 level and one of the predictions we had while the market was floating around right here is that we may get something on a smaller time frame if this market pushed up that gives us an opportunity to go long and we actually got that in way of a flag pattern. And what I'm going to do is go ahead and drop down to a smaller time frame and show you guys that. So here we are on a 1 hour chart and this is exactly what we were predicting guys at the time we had already pushed up above our daily level of structure here in red and then this market created this nice pinnet pattern and broke out of it pushing up to the exact level we pointed out in last week's video at the 1.2049 level giving us an opportunity to go short and a counter trend trade back down all the way to the zone we talked about in last week's video. Again these are predictions that we made based on understanding how to read structure. So now that we've pushed back down into this other daily zone we're looking for long opportunities and as you can see the market eventually does push back up from this zone all the way up to our 1.2049 level once again. So as you can see considering last week's analysis on this pair it all seemed to play out quite nicely and we did get a couple of good trading opportunities from that here at the trading channel. But that's enough about what's already happened that's the things we've already seen out of this market. Now let's zoom back out to the daily chart and check out what we can expect next from the euro dollar. Well we are hovering around that same 1.2049 level that level is a major resistance level out here on the daily chart so we can be looking for shorting opportunities from here where we are. Now if this market breaks above this resistance level at 1.2049 we can look for long opportunities all the way up to 1.2295 that's going to be our next key level of structure resistance that we're waiting on the market to hit to look for possible counter-trend trading opportunities on this market. So there's a couple levels of resistance that we're looking at and paying attention to for trading opportunities as for support we'll go ahead and change the color of this line to blue because now the market is pushed above this level. This is going to be a level of support at 1.1886 and that's all to where we'd look for more long trading opportunities in order to get involved with the trend here on the euro dollars you can tell we are in a pretty nice uptrend here on this pair and on this timeframe. So other than that if we break through the 1.1886 zone then the next level of support we'll be looking at is right down here at 1.1645 and that zone is where we'll be looking for other long opportunities that this market does break below our first support level at 1.1886 and so we'll be looking at zones that look something like this for trading opportunities here on the euro dollar. The top two zones will be our major levels of resistance that we're looking for counter-trend shorting opportunities from the bottom two zones are major levels of support that we're looking for buying opportunities off of here at the trading channel and that's what we're going to be looking at here on the euro dollar now let's go ahead and move along to another pair in the Aussie dollar and take a look at some of the key levels of structure on that pair. Now in this pair again this market performed quite nicely in consideration of our forex predictions from last week so I'll play you guys a clip from that video yet again and here as you can see we're actually involved in a trade still that we ended up getting based on that structure level and the analysis from last week and in that analysis we were pointing out this level in blue as support for trading opportunities to push up into our next daily level of resistance at 0.8020 and that's exactly what we got so I'll go ahead and play a clip from last week's video showing you guys that prediction and then we'll come right back to discuss the trading opportunity we took advantage of and the new key levels we're paying attention to here on the Aussie dollar. And as for support if this market breaks back down we'll be looking for support once more at the 0.788 zone and if we break all right guys so just like we were talking about in last week's prediction video we were actually right here on this candle when we said we may be looking for another push down into our support level is 0.7886 we got that nice push down and down on a lower time frame we actually got a good reason for entry at that level which has now allowed us to bank in over a hundred pips on this Aussie dollar trade so let's head down to a lower time frame and take a look at that trade before we discussed the new key levels of structure for the Aussie dollar let's go ahead jump down to a one hour chart and here on the one hour time frame our entry reason was based on a lot of buying pressure that we saw out of this area so since we saw some buying pressure come in right around this key level of support that we discussed in last week's predictions video we decided to go ahead and take out a long position and I'll put on the long position tool and show you guys exactly what we were looking for we decided to put our stop loss under our lowest level of support around this consolidation zone and around this daily level of structure right here so the stop loss just under that and our first targets up here at this previous daily level of structure that gave us almost a two to one to our first targets which have already been hit and now currently we're sitting with our stop loss just to blow this level here so we're waiting to see if this market can in fact continue in the upward direction and give us an added bonus for these target number twos that's what we were looking at last week and how we benefited from that analysis now let's look at what we can look for on the Aussie dollar coming up in the next week so zoom back out to the daily chart and discuss the key levels of structure we'll be paying attention to for trading opportunities now today we are hovering around this potential structure reversal zone in this zone we can be looking for reasons to go short on the Aussie dollar as a counter trend opportunity and if this market does break and close above the zone and continue higher our next level of resistance will be the 0.8105 zone this is where we'll be looking for our next counter trend possibilities and for our second level of resistance if this market does break above the 0.8105 zone then we have a long ways to go and just as with the euro dollar we can look for some long opportunities in between that first resistance level and the 0.8223 zone which is our next level that we'll be paying attention to for counter trend trades and possible shorting opportunities now as for support we have a couple of different scenarios here we can see this market push up and close above our previous level of resistance and if that happens then we'll be looking at this zone as support the zone around 0.8020 to be our first level of support if we get a nice close above our current resistance zone now if the market does push lower than that then we'll be looking yet again just as last week at the 0.7886 zone and if we go much lower than that then we can look for long opportunities around 0.7807 so that's going to be what we're looking for here only Aussie dollar in the coming days and weeks oh this video was beneficial and helpful to your trading and if you enjoyed the content guys then go ahead and click that like button for me remember I'm trying to hit 300 lights on this video so you could take just one second and do that it would be much appreciated if you're interested in learning about the strategies and specific entry reasons that I actually use in the market and other ways that I incorporate structure into my personal trading and if you're currently struggling to create your own trading success then I'm gonna leave a link in the description below the video to the training program we offer here at the trading channel called the EAP the EAP training program has helped hundreds of traders already achieve trading success and you'll stick around to the end of the video you can read through some of their testimonials so if you're struggling with your trading or if you just like to learn some new strategies and techniques then you can learn more about that training program by clicking the link in the description below remember if you'd like free courses on structure and advanced patterns then you can do so by clicking the link in the description labeled free training and signing up for our email list over at thetradingchannel.net be sure to subscribe here if you are new to make sure you're alerted next time we come out with the 4X market predictions videos I wish you guys all the best of luck in your future trades and I'll talk to you in the next one you
