Traders welcome to this week's weekly market predictions. We have a short week in the market this week because of the Thanksgiving holiday here in the US but nonetheless let's go ahead and get prepared by taking a look at some of the major levels of structure on the top five major pairs and discussing how we're going to trade each of these pairs throughout this short week.

I'm gonna go ahead and let the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll be right back to talk to you guys about our trading predictions for this week. As for the immediate future on the dollar in we'll be looking for some kind of shorting opportunity and some type of shorting entry reason in order to capture some trend continuation and ride this market all the way down to the 111.79 area. Let's zoom back out to the... What you just saw was a clip from last Monday's weekly market predictions on the dollar yen and we're back on that dollar yen pair now. Last Monday we predicted this market would continue in the downward direction and I'll zoom back out to a daily chart to kind of go over that analysis once more with you guys but as you can see this market ended up doing exactly what we predicted. We came off this daily level of structure started making new lower lows and lower highs putting us into a possible reversal because the market previously was in an uptrend and then we pulled back some and got a little entry reason out of this pair and we've since then taken off first targets and continued to hold this position waiting on a test of our next support level at around 111.79. Now we got pretty close to that support level but unfortunately we were not paying attention to the chart at this point in time so we weren't able to take off that position. Now the market's rallied upside but we're still expecting this market to make another lower high and lower low down here towards at least this support level. So let's zoom out to the daily chart and take a look at why we expected this to be a possible reversal. Here we are on that dollar end daily chart guys and as you can see we had a level of structure right here that have been tested multiple times as resistance and support back in the past so that meant that this level of structure was an important level of structure we were going to be paying attention to. When the market got up to this level we put in a lot of selling pressure with these candle wigs showing us that this was a possible place the market would find resistance so now we have two separate conditions we have a level of structure that was tested in respect to multiple times in the past along with selling pressure at that level based on candlestick analysis. After that we waited on another condition so as you can see we're not just waiting on the market to get to these structure levels we're waiting on the market to get these structure levels and then we're applying different conditions to help make our predictive analysis more accurate so after getting here putting in selling pressure then we look down on a smaller time frame and saw that this market was creating lower lows and lower highs and that indicated that this was a reversible zone so once we have all those indications that the market might head lower that's when we started looking for an entry reason and ended up getting one around the 113.47 area directly after that the market pushed down pretty dramatically over the next couple of days easily hitting our first target and now continuing with this position hoping we can get some more trend continuation and head a little lower here on the dollar yen and that's how our analysis played out from last Monday's weekly market predictions here on this pair. Now let's go ahead and discuss a little bit about what we're expecting next out of the dollar yen. So next up for the dollar yen we're looking to see if we can get some kind of push down even further towards the 111.79 area which is a level that's been respected multiple times in the past so this is going to be our next major level of support. If we get to this area we'll be looking for a reason to possibly take a counter-trend trade towards the upwards direction on a smaller time frame. Now if we push below that we'll be looking for reasons to short this market all the way down to the 110.47 area. If we get there we'll be looking forward yet again another counter-trend opportunity down on a smaller time frame to go long. That's it for support on the dollar yen. Now for resistance if this market pushes up from this level or we push a little lower and push up from our support level our next possible resistance level is going to be right around here at the 113 even handle we have this level of resistance that has been respected in the past and if we get above that we'll be looking at the 114.23 area for a possible shorting opportunity and above that at the 114.95 around the 115 even handle for our next possible resistance level. So that's our predictive analysis here on the dollar yen. Now we'll go ahead and move on to our next pair which is going to be the euro dollar. Last week on the euro dollar we talked about this level right here around the 1.1686 level is being a level of resistance we were paying attention to for a trading opportunity. The market got to that level but then pushed straight up with this big green candle never giving us an opportunity to get involved in a short trade from that zone but then we made it up to our next level that we discussed in last week's video around the 1.1862 zone. The market put in a nice candle wick showing selling pressure right at that zone and since then it's pushed down over 120 pips from that area and if you'd like to learn more about how we make predictive analysis like this each and every week then you can click the link in the description labeled EAP training program. There's a special discount on that program just for you guys so click that link if you're interested in learning more about our analysis. Now as for the euro dollar and as for this week we're gonna be changing this 1.1686 level here into support since the market has now broken above it so instead of red we're gonna change this line to blue and we'll be looking at this level for a possible level of support. If the market makes it down to this level we'll be looking to take a long opportunity from this zone and if we push below that then we'll be looking at the 1.1453 area as our next level of support and next level to take a possible long trade from. Other than that if the market pushes back up yet again towards the 1.1862 zone then that's where we'll be looking for our next shorting opportunity out of this market and above that around the 1.2060 level these previous highs looking left. So that is our predictive analysis here on the euro dollar and that's what we'll be paying attention to for the rest of the week when it comes to trading opportunities on this pair. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair which is going to be the Aussie dollar. The more likely scenario is that the market actually breaks through this level because of how many times it's been tested and the market was unable to put any kind of real rally up to break above our previous support levels or even to our next resistance level. So because of that we're expecting this market to continue in this downward direction and we're just waiting for more confirmation on this next candle here on the Aussie dollar. Now if we get that confirmation let's say this so last Monday on the Aussie dollar our prediction was that this market would continue lower and that's exactly what we've seen out of this market. As you can see this market is now broken below not only that support level we were discussing last week but also the next support level we had pushing all the way down to our 0.7534 level. Now at this level if we go to a lower time frame and see some kind of entry reason we will be taking advantage of that as a counter-trend trade and next up we actually have to point out another level of support. So let's zoom the chart out and take a look at the next level that's been tested in respect to multiple times by this pair that we can use as support. So the next level that I see is right here. This is a level the Aussie dollar has used as support multiple times and if we make it down to this level it's a level we'll be looking at as support once more. That level is around the 0.7459 zone so those are our levels of support here on the Aussie dollar and next up we're gonna be taking a look at the levels of resistance. These two lines above price action now need to be changed to red because they are now resistance levels since the market is closed below them. So on smaller time frames we'll be looking for a rally out of this market to get up to the 0.7584 zone that's what we'll be looking for some kind of shorting opportunity out of this pair above that we'll be looking around the 0.7627 area that's where we saw some of this consolidation here in the past along with other levels of support and resistance that have been respected looking left. That's a level we'll also be looking for some trend continuation shorting opportunities from and if we do push above those two levels that are pretty close together we'll be looking around the 0.7735 zone as our next level of resistance here for the Aussie dollar and that's gonna do it for this pair that is our predictions on the Aussie dollar. Next up we'll be taking a look at the pound dollar and discussing the levels of structure we're paying attention to on that pair throughout the rest of this week. Here on the pound dollar we've been in this period of consolidation between the 1.3305 zone and the 1.3056 zone for the last couple of months so really nothing has changed on this pair. What we're looking for out of this pair is some type of reason to go short in between the 1.3305 and the 1.3246 zone. We're looking for short entry reasons here as this is the most previous level of resistance on this pair. We'll be looking for long trades if this pair pushes down to the support level of this period of consolidation around the 1.3056 zone. That'll be our first level of support if we break through that we'll be looking around the 1.2850 level for our next level of support out of this pair. Now anywhere in between these two areas right in here we're not looking for any type of trade because this is a period of consolidation and when the market starts to do this it can really whips all around in between these two areas a lot. So we will not be paying attention in between these areas for any type of trade. Instead we'll be waiting on this market to either break below like we just discussed or if we break above this resistance level we may look for some long opportunities up to the 1.344 area. That'll be our first level of resistance if we break out of this period of consolidation and above that around the 1.359 area will be the second level of resistance looking left at these highest highs. Next up our final pair of the video will be the dollar Swiss. Here on the dollar Swiss we have a market that is in an uptrend making new higher highs and higher lows and has now pulled back to a previous major level of structure support and resistance. So around the 0.9873 area is a great level to look for long opportunities here on this pair. As you can see we have our wick here showing us some buying pressure out of the zone and meaning that the market could possibly see some support out of this area. Now we have already pushed up a couple of times from this zone so we'll be keeping not here to see if we get some kind of other entry reason out of the 0.9873 zone. If we push below that our next level of support will be the 0.9740 area and these levels are levels that we discussed not only in last Monday's weekly market prediction video but also for the last couple of weeks. So as you can see staying ahead of the market and staying prepared by pointing out these levels of structure can be very beneficial to a trading plan and to a trading strategy. Now since the market has broken below the 0.9957 zone we're going to go and change this line to red. This is a possible level of resistance. Now what we do have to consider is the fact that this market is in a pretty strong uptrend recently. So because of that this level of resistance although it is resistance in a possible place for a counter trend shorting opportunity we're also going against the underlying trend of the market if we decide to take a short trade from this area. So what that means is we better have a pretty good entry reason on a lower time frame in order to take that as a short trade. But nonetheless that is our first level of resistance looking around the 0.9957 area and above that if the market pushes higher we'll be looking around the 1.0089 areas our next level of resistance and once more at the 1.0167 zone. Those are our levels of support and resistance here for the dollar Swiss and that's what we're paying attention to on the top five major pairs for this week.
