Winning 100% of the time while trading is not possible. What that means is that you will have losses. No matter what strategy you're trading, no matter how good you get a trading, you're never going to know exactly what the market's going to do. Back when I first started trading, for some reason, I truly believed that the reason professional traders made money is because they knew exactly what price was going to do. And every trade they place, they just won those trades. But throughout my trading career, I learned that that's not the case at all. The truth is that we are trading as professional traders. Whenever you become a professional trader, you will be trading based on a statistic advantage that plays out over a large sample size of trades. So it's not about knowing exactly what the market's going to do. It's about trading a proven rules-based system that's proven to be profitable over a large sample size of trades and that you know create profits if you do it over and over again, even though it will have some losses in between.
