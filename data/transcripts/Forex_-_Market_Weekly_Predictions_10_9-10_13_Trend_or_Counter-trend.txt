What's up traders welcome to another weekly market predictions video. Let's go ahead and start the week off right by making our predictions on these top five major pairs in This video will be talking about major levels of structure directional biases and exactly how we plan to trade each of the top five major pairs Throughout this week if that sounds like it'll bring value to your trading Then go ahead and click that like button and make sure that if you're new You go ahead and subscribe here to the trading channel be alerted when we come out with new weekly market prediction videos Right now, I'm gonna go ahead and let the intro and disclaimer roll and we'll get this week's video started on the other side All right, so we're gonna start this week's analysis out on the euro dollar and last week on this pair We talked about the 1.16 665 zone as being a level of structure that we needed to pay attention to because it acted as support and resistance in the past So this is going to be a major level of structure the market has just pulled into that level So that could be a nice zone to start looking for some buying opportunities in a second We'll go down to a smaller time frame and take a look at how we can take advantage of this and also discuss a little bit about the difference between Trend trading and counter trend trading but first let's go ahead and discuss the other major levels of structure That we're gonna be paying attention to on this market throughout this week and probably in the next week as well Of course, we have the zone that we pointed out last week that the markets currently around which is the 1.1665 zone So level will be looking at for possible buying opportunities throughout this week and in the immediate future if the market breaks below that level Then we're gonna be looking at our next level of support around 1.14 5 3 that'll be the next level of support we look at for buying opportunities Which at that point will be a counter trend trading opportunity? Now as for resistance if this market pushes up from the level we're at right now our first stop For resistance and for a possible shorting opportunity is around 1.18 75 that's where we'll be looking at for any type of sign that the market wants to move lower so that we can take advantage of that To the downside and if the market breaks above that then we'll be looking back here at our highs around the 1.20 60 zone for our next level to try and take this market short So those are the levels we're paying attention to here on the euro dollar now Let's talk a little bit about how we can take advantage of this market exactly where it's at right now So to do that we're gonna go ahead and move down to a trading time frame Which for me is a four hour or one hour chart? So right now we're gonna take a look at the four hour chart and as you can see here We push down into this zone that we pointed out last week We've had a little bit of a rally coming up now to start off with let's talk a little more about the difference between trend and counter Trend trading. Let me just delete this box that we have here. So here on the four hour chart What do you expect that if we take a long trade will this be a trend or counter trend trade now? Remember we took a look at the daily chart and this is in an obvious uptrend right if we zoom the chart out You can see that as for pretty much the entire year of 2017 this market has been going up So again, we go back down to the four hour What kind of trade is this going to be? Well, this is actually going to be a counter trend trade guys because here on our trading time frame This market is actually in a downtrend and this is a little more complicated analysis that I normally go into here on YouTube But for those of you who have watched these weekly prediction videos for a while You're probably starting to get a hang of the more simple aspects of using structure to determine market direction And I want to give you guys this information because I think it'll be really beneficial for your trading So we know that this market is in a downtrend the reason is because we have a high here and a low here Followed by this new low which is lower than our previous low new lower high new lower low new lower high new lower low New lower high now. We've made another new lower low now after that new lower low here on the four hour chart We expect a continuation of this trend here on this chart if we are trading trend continuation If that's what you've decided to be then you are looking for this market to continue down before breaking above this high So if you were to take a long position on this time frame here based on an entry reason you get on the four hour chart That's going to be a counter trend trade and the reason I bring this up is because this is probably the question I get asked most commonly by traders What if I have an entry to go long and an entry to go short near the same position? Well, the first thing I would say about that and the first suggestion I would have is that if you're not profitable as a trader quite yet, then the best suggestion I could give you is a pick one or the other if you're just starting out or if You're not quite profitable yet It's gonna be a lot easier for you to trade if you consistently look for either a trend continuation trade or a counter trend trade And so that's the easiest answer to this question that I would have if you're a trading continuation trader right now You would be looking for a reason to go short and continue this trend we have on the four hour chart Which is definitely down based on the market structure We can see and if you're a counter trend trader then you're looking for some kind of reason to go long from this level because we are at this Higher time frame level of structure now once you get enough experience once you become profitable at one or the other You can start to include trades from both sides of those two spectrums You can include counter trend trades into your trading plan by creating a counter trend trading strategy And when when that's the case when you're capable of doing that the best way I've found To pick between the two trades is just to trade the first one that I see so for my trading plan I have counter trend entries along with Trained continuation entries and if this market is down at this level and gives me a counter trend entry Then I will take that counter trend entry and no matter what happens after that I'm staying in that trade until it either gets stopped out or hits at least my first target So guys, that's a little bit about how you can tell the difference in a trend Continuation and counter trend trade and also a little more about how to pick between the two again if you're someone just starting out I would definitely suggest just picking either to be a counter trend or to be a trend continuation Trader in the beginning and so as for right now on this euro dollar personally We're gonna be looking for either a trend continuation setup to go short out of this pair or if the market doesn't give us a setup To go short and instead pulls back without giving us that entry reason to this level around 1.1 665 then that's an area we'll be looking for an entry reason to the to the upside to go ahead and get involved in a long Position here on the euro dollar. So now we've discussed this euro dollar pair Let's go ahead and take a look at our next pair and see what we're expecting out of the Aussie dollar So here we are on our next pair the Aussie dollar and on this pair last week We were taking a look at this level here as a possible level to look for a long opportunity But on our lower time frame we did not end up getting anything at this level Which is a good thing because the market did end up pushing below that level after that small rally So now that that's happened. What are we looking for next out of this pair? Well, if we look to the left you can see this level of support has now been broken and closed below and this market is in an Obvious downtrend on a four-hour time frame as well So this market is in trink continuation to the downside on our lower time frame But as it sits right now We are at the 0.7732 zone that we pointed out in last week's video as a level of support So what are we to do? We go ahead and change this to red and as usual guys the answer that question highly depends on your trading plan and your Specific trading style, but for me the 0.7732 level although it is a great zone out here on the daily time frame Due to the amount of times we've seen this level respected as structure resistance in the past This really could be a nice area for a bounce But I know my next level of major resistance is a 0.781 looking right here at this new red line and This level of previous support on the daily chart and since that is going to be a major level of structure resistance I want to get my targets off if I do try to get involved in the counter trend trade on lower time frame to go Long on this pair I want to have my targets taken off before this level and with that being the case it may be difficult If I get an entry in here to get a stop loss below this low and get a decent risk reward or even a one-to-one risk reward Up to that level so this is not an optimal situation for a long opportunity here on the Aussie dollar What I plan to look for instead unless we can get a push down and a nice entry a lot closer to the 0.7732 zone Unless we get something really nice a little bit lower down and closer to that zone when it comes to a long opportunity What I'm really looking for out of the Aussie dollar is a push From that zone back up into this daily level of structure along with level of structure that's been tested multiple times in the past on this chart And hopefully getting a nice shorting opportunity here to not only follow the new trend here on the daily chart As you can see breaking below this structure But also the four-hour bearish trend that we'll see here in just a second Where if we drop down to that smaller time frame as of right now though We need to be looking for our next level of support because we only have one blue line here So let's drag this down and change the color Zoom the chart out and find the next level we can look at for support out of this pair Right here is a level that stands out to me and the reason for that is because the amount of times we've seen this level act as Support and resistance before in the past as you can see tested here multiple times In both directions So because of that if the market comes down lower if we break below the 0.7732 zone that we have and that we're sitting at right now Our next level of support for the Aussie dollar be 0.7618 in that zones Where we'll be looking for counter trend long opportunities out of this pair if the market pushes up as we just talked about We'll be looking at the 0.7814 zone That's a level where we can look for trend continuation trades out of this pair to the short side now If the market breaks above that level and continues higher then we can look around the 0.7898 level That'll be our next level to look for a shorting opportunity out of this pair and now Let's go ahead delete these drawings and drop down to a smaller time frame on the four-hour chart to talk about our Directional bias and the reason for that bias on this pair So as you can see Aussie dollar in a downtrend currently creating our lower highs lower lows lower highs lower lows This could be our lower high or as we discussed on that higher daily time frame What we're really looking for is a possible move up into our red line or into this zone here To look for a possible trading opportunity to the downside and for continuation here on this four-hour down trend So that's some of the things we're looking at here on the Aussie dollar the next pair We're gonna take a look at is the pound dollar so we go ahead and head to that chart now So here we are on the pound dollar and I'm gonna go through this pretty quickly because this analysis is very similar to the analysis We did on the Aussie dollar so as you can see this market is at a nice daily level of structure right here The reason we know that is because we've seen this level act as support support resistance resistance Multiple times in the past so now we assume this level could act as support once more now the only problem with that as with the Aussie dollar I'll zoom the chart in here is that if we get an entry right where the market is now There's really no way for us to put a stop loss below that swing low and get targets off before our next major level of resistance looking here to the left and get a decent risk reward There's no way we can even get a one-to-one with that being the case So not an optimal spot for a counter trend opportunity because of how close this level of resistance is right here So just as with the Aussie dollar what we can do is either wait for this market to pull down and get a little closer to this 1.30 five zone Right in here and look for an entry after the market pulls down into that area that way we can have a stop loss below this little wick here and targets Below our next level of resistance and still get a decent risk to reward ratio And the other thing we're looking for out of the pound dollar just as with the Aussie dollar is a nice push up to this 1.32 33 zone and that'll give us a good trend continuation opportunity to the downside So that's what we're looking at here on the pound dollar So other than in the immediate future what else could we expect out of this pair? Well, if the market pushes below this support level that we're at currently and makes it all the way down to the 1.2850 level That'll be the next level of support we look at for counter trend long opportunity on this pair And if we get a push above the resistance level we were just talking about We could see this market make it all the way to 1.34 In that zone's the next place we'll be looking for shorting opportunities here on the pound dollar So that's what we'll have an eye on here on this pair. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair Which is gonna be the dollar Swiss? So here on the dollar Swiss last week we actually had some advanced pattern setups right here in this area And they did not play out too well We ended up getting stopped out on those trades and we'll discuss a little more about that in just a second But this pair has just broken above this top level of consolidation that we had and could continue to move higher So that's gonna take our most previous level of resistance and turn it into support and now we can actually point out a new level of resistance Above where price action is now on this pair The most obvious place of resistance that I see is right here And I'm sure you can already see why at this level we have multiple touches of resistance in the past So if the market pushes up to the 1.008 zone Then that's a level we'll be looking at to see this market as a shorting opportunity and that level is pretty far away Other than that what we're looking at is a possible move up into 0.9869 on this pair That'll be another level we can look for counter trend Shorting opportunities and as for the immediate future something we can look for this week is a possible move back down into the 0.97 4 7 zone and we can look for some long opportunities for trend continuation on this pair in that zone now There's trend continuation here lining up on the daily and for our chart So after we take a look at our next level of support for the USD Swiss then we'll drop down to a smaller time frame Discuss the potential trade we had last week and some other things we can look for when it comes to trading this pair throughout the rest of this week But if this market pushes down below the 0.97 4 7 level the next level will be looking at for support and for long trading opportunities It's a 0.96 to 8 in that zone will be looking for a reason to go long on the dollar Swiss So now let's go ahead and drop down to a smaller time frame and first we're going to go down to the one-hour chart Here on the one-hour chart is where we had those advanced patterns from last week's weekly predictions video And as you can see the market made it up to our entry on those advanced patterns and instead of pushing down to hit our targets Unfortunately pushed up and stopped us out. We had a stop loss of our right in this area Market barely stopping us out before pushing down and hitting what would have been our first targets on these advanced patterns There was a cipher and a garlic pattern all in the same area lining up with a daily level of resistance Which is why we decided to take this market short at that area Unfortunately the market did not cooperate with our analysis So let's go ahead and go back out to a four hour chart and see how we can take advantage of this pair for the rest of this week All right, so currently as you can see this four hour chart in a nice uptrend. We have a market making lows higher highs higher lows higher highs higher lows higher highs and what we can expect is a new higher high Out of this pair and we have some room up here into the 0.9869 area So if this market can give us a move down to the 0.97 4-7 area that that'll be a great spot to look for some trend continuation opportunity To the upside here on the dollar Swiss and that's the things we'll be paying attention to here on this pair throughout this week Next up and our final pair of the day is gonna be the dollar in so we'll go ahead and head to that chart now So here we are on that last pair on the dollar yin and last week We actually had a pretty good trade out of this pair in the EAP training program that ended up being a one-target winner So what I'll do first is take you guys to that email that was sent out to all EAP members Here's that email along with an entry stop and target that I set for each of these emails for the traders that are Involved in the EAP so they can better understand what I'm looking at and how I'm trading in the markets Now if we head back over to the dollar yin you can see that that trade worked out quite nicely coming up to hit our first targets Right in here now. Why did we want to place a trade like this? Well as you can see this blue line here was a previous level of resistance the market then broke above that level of resistance Pulled back and made a new higher high since we made that higher high What were we looking for? Well, we were looking for the market to continue and make new higher highs, right? Which it has done now now we have closed above this level yet again And although we wanted to see a pullback all the way into this 111.92 area We ended up getting an EAP entry closer to this area right here Which is how we took advantage of that trade and ended up making in around? 64 pips on the first part of that position before being stopped out on the second part of that position for break even Along with that guys on the daily chart We have a lot of momentum to the upside and this market has just broken above some levels of resistance out here on this daily chart So we have all this momentum to the upside and the market finally starting to pull back a little bit here Which gave us reason to want to get involved and I was hoping for a second targets to be close to this 114 even handle but the market at this point is pulled back and stopped us out And we may get another opportunity to go long here out of this pair If we can see it pull back into the 111.92 area and give some kind of entry reason to go long If we break below the 111.92 area We may see this market find some support around the 110.8 to the 111 even handled zone And that'll be the next level we look at for a long trading opportunity And what else can we look for here out of the dollar yen? Well, if we get a push higher here out of this pair We're gonna be looking at the 114 even to the 114.18 area as a level of resistance that we can take advantage of shorting Opportunities from if we break above that level we'll be looking around the 115 even handle for the next level of resistance And I actually got a pretty cool email yesterday from a client in the EAP This trader made it through one of his first drawdowns with lab money and sent me a thank you email Tell me that being a part of the EAP made it a lot easier to go through that drawdown So that emails on your screen if you'd like to read through it And that's something that I think is really important for all new traders to understand is that drawdowns are Absolutely a part of any trading strategy or any trading plan your discipline to your trading plan and ability to trade through those drawdowns Will be the determining factor of whether or not you become successful in this trading business And if you're someone who struggles with that who finds himself jumping from strategy to strategy Then I'd recommend trying out the EAP training program and seeing if it can help you on your path to becoming profitable Just as it has mr.
