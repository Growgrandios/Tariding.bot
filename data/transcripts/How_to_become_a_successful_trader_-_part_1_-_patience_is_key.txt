In this week's video, we're going to be discussing something very important in trading and that is patience. Patience as a trader is going to be one of the key aspects that helps you become successful and profitable. So what I'm going to do is go ahead and let the intro and disclaimer roll. As I said, make sure to click that subscribe button. While the intro and disclaimer rolls, make sure to click that like button for me and I'll be right back to talk to you guys a little more about how we can incorporate patience into our trading. All right guys, so welcome back. We'll go ahead and jump into today's topic which is patience in our trading and when most people think of patience in their trading, they think of after they start trading with live money, they need to be patient, right? Well, for me, that's not the case. I actually think of patience as being something we need to incorporate in our trading way before we go live. Patience needs to happen during our testing process as patience needs to happen during our process of creating a trading plan and patience definitely needs to happen in our process of starting to trade. Now, what do I mean by that? From what I've seen from members of the EAP along with other various traders that I know, I would say a good 80% of people begin trading with live money way before they're ready and you may fall into that category. You may be someone who has already begun trading with live money in and what I'd like to say about that is it's never too late to just stop trading altogether. For now, until you get the first step, the first step is going to be learning how to trade and learning how to trade is not a short or easy process. Forex trading is not something you get rich quick at as a lot of marketers and a lot of other teachers would lead you to believe. This is something that takes a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of discipline in order to master. So one way you can incorporate patience into your trading is to be patient before you ever start trading with live money. And doing that means that you learn to read structure. You learn to create a strategy, either you learn a strategy from someone else, you test the strategy you learn from someone else or the one that you create to see if it's profitable to make sure whoever's teaching the strategy that you're either trading it the same way they are in order to make it a profitable strategy or to make sure they even know what they're talking about while they're teaching the strategy. And if it's a strategy you've created on your own, then you definitely want to do the same. You want to be testing it to make sure throughout historical data it's proven to be profitable in the past, which is in no way an indication that it's going to be profitable in the future. But it does give us a chance to make an estimated guess and have an edge over the market. And an estimated guess and being scientific about your trading is always going to put you in a much better position to be profitable than just throwing darts blindly in an effort to win trades. So once you have that estimated guess, once you have that back tested strategy that you have either learned from someone or created on your own, you're still not through with the process. It's still time to be patient guys. You should still wait and actually open a demo account first to make sure that your time constraints, maybe you have a full time or even a part time job. That doesn't allow you to be in friendly computer all the time or maybe other activities are influencing your time in a way that keep you from being able to trade all the time. So opening a demo account will allow you to see if your time constraints allow you to be able to trade the strategy you've picked correctly. Let's say you're a person with a full time job and you've picked a strategy that's more of a day trading strategy on an hour or 15 minute time frame. Let's say that strategy consists of structure and let's say that it's almost a reversal strategy. So right here, let's say your strategy is that when the market has been going down for a while as we see the market going down here. And then finally breaks resistance as we do here. Then you wait for a pullback into that resistance down the 15 minute timeframe. Now the reason I'm saying be patient and make sure to do this in a forward testing account is because and when I say forward testing guys, I mean a demo account and you're going to be able to do that. I mean a demo account and not with a lot of money is because if you're trading the strategy with a full time job and you back test it and it's proven to be extremely profitable. You're really excited. But when you back tested, you tested it as if you could take every single trade. Right. Now tell me, do you think you'll be able to consistently place every single trade with a full or part time job? I mean, you sleep, right? Even even without full and part time jobs, you're still going to be sleeping. So that's why it's important to go ahead and go through that forward testing process for a while to see. And you also want to remember this while back testing. If you're back testing some kind of day trading strategy, you want to only test or only count the trades that are in the area of time that you're going to be awake and right in front of your computer only smaller timeframes. This is why personally, I enjoy swing trading much more than I do day trading, but I know a lot of you out there interested in day trading. And I thought that was something really good to point out for you guys is that that's one of the reasons you want to forward test strategies before ever going live. And that's also another thing you want to remember is to make sure that the trades you're testing are in the time that you have in order to sit in front of your computer and trade. So that's one reason for forward testing. Another reason for forward testing is because during your back testing process, you probably don't account for the spread or being slipped on positions, which will happen with no matter what broker you're with. You're going to be slipped on positions from time to time. Your targets may be hit on the chart with a candle wick and then you may look at your account and go, why was that not a winning trade? That's just something that happens. So that's something you can't account for in your back testing, but throughout your forward testing process, you can see how that affects your strategy. And the forward testing process, guys, again, this is an area where you have to be patient. You can't go through it quickly and expect to only forward test for a month and be fine. You're not going to have enough trades unless you are trading on a low timeframe, like the 15 minute chart. But let's say you have an hourly chart strategy. Say you're trading out here with a similar strategy, you know, we have, or even the strategy I used here on the pound. This is a video I shot last week that was called how to trade the breakout before the breakout. As you can see, this trade has now went even further in our direction. We're up a little over 500 pips at this point. Really good trade. Well, for this trade, we're waiting on a break of support and a flag pattern. But as we got this flag pattern, I was showing traders how I managed to get involved in this trade before the breakout even happened. And I'll put a link for that video in the top right hand corner of the screen. But back to the topic at hand, if you only forward test for a month on a strategy that's out here on this four hour chart, you're not going to have very many trades, maybe three, four, five, if it's something that happens a lot. And of course, there could be a little more than that, but that's nowhere near the amount of trades you need during a forward testing process in order to get confident in the strategy. So another thing to remember is it depends on your time frame. And again, guys, the main point of this is make sure you're patient. I'm just trying to point out places that I've seen traders rush and that that rush of time, that lack of patience has actually caused some of these traders to be unsuccessful and even to get frustrated to the point of quitting trading altogether. And that's the reason I wanted to create this video. I know it's not the most exciting video. I'm not showing strategies or what structure levels I'm looking at, but guys, this is just as important as either of those things. And this is something that's definitely not talked about enough. And now onto another topic. I've actually been receiving a lot of questions and comments about how many trades to test when back testing and forward testing and how long to test while you're in your forward testing process. And another important thing to remember is that you're trying to become an independently profitable trader. You don't want to be someone that depends on another individual to send you trades like a signal service or someone who depends on another individual to point out structure levels for you. You want to be independently profitable. And a part of that is understanding yourself. So when traders ask me how many trades should I look at throughout my back testing process, I can tell you how many trades I look at. I can tell you the distance of time that I need in order to be confident in a forward testing process in a demo account. But that's not necessarily the same amount of time you need. And that's not necessarily the same amount of trades you need. It depends on the person, your entire purpose of doing this back testing and forward testing is to become very confident in that strategy. So how many trades would it take you to be confident in a strategy? How many trades do you need to test? Is it a hundred? Is it a thousand? At what point do you go? Okay, I've tested 500 trades now. And I've seen that throughout these 500 trades, I still have a 65% chance of winning with this strategy. Does that make you confident? Or do you only need a hundred? And this is why I don't really reply to negative comments on YouTube very much as well because these people that leave these negative comments are very, very close minded. They don't understand that just because I'm doing something differently they are or they're doing something differently than I am, that doesn't mean that either of us are wrong. I do the things I do because of the way I back tested in the market because I became an independently profitable trader. Meaning that the things, the rules I use, the strategies I use, I created all of them myself and just tested them throughout historical data in order to make sure that I had an edge over the market every time I place a trade. But off the negative comments now, let's continue talking about patients in our trading. So now we've gotten through the forward testing process and we've gotten through the back testing process. Let's say you've come up with an amount of trades, maybe you need 200 to be confident. So you test 200 trades in the market, you have a strategy that's 65% accurate and you see that it gives you an edge over the market over the course of 200 trades. Another thing to remember in back testing is to make sure you go along in a long enough period back so that you're in consolidating markets and trending markets because you could be on an hourly chart. Let's say for this entire time here, I'm going to put some horizontal lines on the screen. You could be on an hourly chart from here to here trading a trend continuation strategy and what do you think you would have a lot of wins. But if you were in a consolidating market like from here to here, as we can see if I draw some horizontal lines on here as well. If you're in this market right here trading a trend continuation strategy, what do you think is going to happen? You're going to be losing trades. So what I mean is make sure that you're going back far enough in time, not only number of trades in order to come to a place on a pair that's had consolidating market times and trending market times. So that's it. Let's continue. Like I said, you've got your back tested strategy. Now you've moved on to your forward testing process and maybe you're getting a few months into that, maybe even six months. Maybe you've decided to be really patient and give yourself a lot of opportunities in the market and a long time to do this. And guys, that's what it takes. That's it's necessary to do that. Don't get frustrated by me telling you that it's going to it's a process that's going to take months. Most careers take years in order to perfect and doing something like this is no different. You're not going to be good at this overnight. It takes practice, dedication and effort. So now you're six months deep into your forward testing process. You see that everything's working out great and it's giving you an edge over the market. You're remaining profitable throughout these full six months. Now's when you can actually decide. Now you've been patient through your back testing process and now's when you can decide whether or not you're ready to put your actual hard earned money at risk in the market. That's the only time is once you've done all that is the only time you should be considering putting your hard earned money in the market. And still it's just a consideration until your confidence is at a point that you know once your hard earned money is in the market you can remain disciplined to that strategy because the next level of patience comes while we're trading with live money. And that's going to be part two of this series guys. I'm going to try to make this a series of how to become a profitable trader and give you guys the steps that I took. And hopefully that'll help you shorten your learning curve and shorten the process. And I really hope this helps some traders avoid the painful reality of losing accounts and losing money in the forex market by getting into the market before they're ready. So guys that's going to do it for today's video. Thank you so much for watching until the end.
