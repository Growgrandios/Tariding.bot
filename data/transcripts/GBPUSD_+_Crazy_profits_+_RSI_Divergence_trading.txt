Hey traders and welcome to the trading channel. In today's video we're going to be talking about the pound dollar. We're going to be talking about some RSI divergence. I'm going to be talking about exactly what RSI divergence is and how you can use it in your trading and incorporate it into strategy creation. Now this video is going to be a bit on the shorter side and the reason for that is because I'm currently producing a brand new strategy tutorial and course for EAP members that I'll be publishing to the website at the end of this week. Now if you're interested in learning more about that brand new strategy and that brand new course or if you'd like to learn more about the EAP which is a forex trading educational program that I run for my website over at the trading channel.net then you click the link in the description labeled EAP and the EAP is a program where I teach you guys the strategies that I use in the market every day and also send you what's called email analysis where I'm emailing you three to five times a week analysis I'm doing on certain forex pairs. So if you're interested in that make sure to click the link in the description below the video otherwise check out the intro and disclaimer and I'll be right back to talk to you guys a little more about the pound dollar in this RSI divergence trading opportunity on this pair. Alright guys so first off let's talk about what is RSI divergence so what I'm going to do is go ahead and delete everything off the screen and I'm going to show you guys exactly what RSI divergence is. As you can see this is our overbought line on our RSI and once this market goes overbought we can start looking for what's called RSI divergence. You can see if we line these up that our first overbought was right here or our highest overbought was this high right here and here's our RSI on that high. The next how we have is obviously higher correct if we put a horizontal line here you can see that that high is definitely higher than this high and now we come down here to our RSI and as you can see the high on the RSI if we do the same thing here and put a horizontal line horizontal line you can see we have a higher high on our price action while having a lower high on our RSI. Now next we have another higher high move our horizontal line up this high is higher than this high and if we move our horizontal line down to this high you can tell on the RSI here that we have a lower high here that is the definition of RSI divergence RSI divergence is when price action is making higher highs while the RSI indicator is making lower highs or when price action is making lower lows and the RSI is making higher lows so how do we take advantage of this? Well just as with every other strategy we need conditions and entry reasons so our condition can absolutely be that we need to see RSI divergence and you can even add to that RSI divergence as I have during this trade this trade is not only RSI divergence but we're also in a previous resistance and support area on the daily time frame which could act as resistance in this level so we have daily structure we're at a daily structure level which is somewhere in this area we also have this RSI divergence so that's our two conditions in this specific strategy and now what we're looking for is an entry reason and guys as we've discussed on this channel before you can come up with your own entry reasons the reason that I've chose on this specific trade is this double top and this shooting star candle combination here as you can see we have this double top and we also have a long wick that pushed up testing these highs and immediately got pushed all the way back down right here so that's telling me we have some selling pressure in this area possibly from the structure level looking left on the daily chart and also possibly from this RSI divergence giving me enough indication to actually go ahead and take this trade so currently before we talk anymore about this trade I am long on the pound dollar at the moment from a trade that we took a few weeks ago in the EAP this trade was bouncing off daily support which is indicated by my blue line here this was a daily support level and what I was waiting for after bouncing off that daily support level is some kind of period of consolidation followed by a breakout so here's a period of consolidation followed by a breakout stop loss below swing low targets are currently sitting at about a 3.1 risk reward and I'm actually going to go ahead and take profits on this trade in order to go short here on the pound dollar and guys again if you're interested in learning more about my forex training program then you can click the link in the description labeled EAP or you can just head over to my website at the trading channel.net and in that program I teach more about how I use breakout trades and the conditions that I have for exclusive strategies that I'm not taught here on YouTube so that was that trade which I'm going to go ahead and take profits for and now that that position has been closed I'm actually going to go ahead and take this market short for the reasons we've discussed we have our RSI divergence our daily level of structure and a double top here with a shooting star candle let's set up our position tool and see if we can get an initial target down here at this previous level of support. All right guys so that was a pound dollar RSI divergence trading opportunity and this is also a trade that I posted here on TradingView what I'm going to do is let this trade play out and I'll be publishing this video as soon as it does so I'll see you guys shortly when this trade either hits targets or gets stopped out and with the power of editing that will happen right now.
