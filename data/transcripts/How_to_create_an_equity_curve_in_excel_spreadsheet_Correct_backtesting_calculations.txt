Hey traders, welcome to the trading channel and welcome to today's video. In today's video we'll be talking about a couple of different things including the calculations you'll need in a back testing spreadsheet in order to find your edge over the market and how to create an equity curve chart in an Excel spreadsheet. So if that sounds interesting to you guys then go ahead and click that like button for me. If you're new, go ahead and subscribe if you'd like to be alerted whenever we come out with other free educational content here on YouTube as well as our weekly market predictions each Monday. So without further ado guys, let's go ahead and get today's video started. So the spreadsheet you see in front of you is an example of a spreadsheet I would have used at the beginning of my trading career. So the first thing we'll talk about is what are the necessary calculations that you need in order to find your edge over the market in a spreadsheet. So as we all know back testing is a huge part of trading. It's the first process you have to go through to figure out if you have an edge over the market and having an edge over the market means that you either win more than you lose with a higher winning percentage like winning at a 60 or 70% winning percentage and a one to one risk reward or winning at a high risk reward ratio, meaning that you only win 50% of the time but you win at a two to one risk reward. Those are two examples of how you could have an edge over the market and we found that edge through a process called back testing which means we're testing the strategies that we're using to gain this edge throughout historical data. Now that's only half the battle because after doing that we have to plug in the numbers we found when I say numbers I mean our stock loss and our targets into a spreadsheet in order to see if we have an edge or an advantage over the market. Now the spreadsheet you see in front of you as an example of a spreadsheet I would have created at the beginning of my trading career. Very plain, very simple and easy to understand. It has the pay or the time, the date, my stock loss, my targets and the pips I made and loss per trade. Now what does this spreadsheet fail to do? This spreadsheet fails to give me any necessary information about how I have an edge over the market so what I would have to do at the beginning of my trading career is take a calculator and go through each of these trades and see how many losses I had. One, two, three, four, five and continue that process throughout all the back tested trades I had in order to find my winning percentage by comparing my wins to my losses. I would have to go through here and add up all these wins and then go through here and add up all the stock loss in order to figure up my average risk to reward ratio just to find that edge over the market. Not to mention trying to figure out my drawdown and the percentage I gained on the account over this long period of time. Now this process isn't very difficult if you have 20 or 30 trades that you're looking at but when it comes to back testing as we all know most of the time we can have hundreds up to thousands of trades that we're taking a look at and going through all of these trades on your spreadsheet and calculating all of this by hand can be an extremely difficult process and not to mention very, very time consuming. So now let's take a look at an example of a spreadsheet that makes the necessary calculations that you need in order to find your edge over the market. Alright so here we are in my current back testing spreadsheet and I also use this for forward testing and to keep up with live trades but as you can see this spreadsheet makes all the necessary calculations for you to figure out what your edge over the market is or also to tell you if you're testing something that's not profitable that doesn't have an edge over the market and it does this by giving you the average PIPS 1, the average stop loss in order to give you the average risk to reward ratio, tells you the total amount of PIPS gained on the account, tell you your total trades, your total wins and losses to give you your winning percentage, your total cash gain, your total percentage gain and your maximum drawdown and a really neat thing that I've incorporated into the spreadsheet as well is an adjustable starting balance and an adjustable risk per position. Also this spreadsheet will automatically calculate the dollars you made or lost per trade, the total account PIPS total account cash per trade, total gain and loss per trade and the total drawdown per trade. So this would be more of a correct back testing spreadsheet giving you all the calculations necessary to actually create a profitable trading strategy and to see how much of an edge you have with that strategy. And just to show you guys exactly how it works what I'm going to do is go ahead and paste in all the numbers from the EAP training program in here and you'll see that all you have to do is enter the pair, time, date, stop loss, target 1 and target 2 and once entered all the other calculations are done for you in a split second. As you can see those calculations were made very quickly and show us that we have an average risk reward of 1.2, we've made around 5,000 total PIPS in the account, we've had 147 trades, 85 wins, 62 losses giving us winning percentage of 57.8%, a total of percentage gain of 123% with a maximum drawdown of 7.73%. Now imagine trying to do all of these calculations by hand with a calculator or on a piece of paper. Needless to say a spreadsheet like this can save you a tremendous amount of valuable time and I highly suggest learning how to create a spreadsheet like this. Personally it took me around 2 years and a little over a thousand dollars paying for Excel spreadsheet courses in order to understand how to create a spreadsheet like this and the necessary functions and formulas it takes to create a spreadsheet that's capable of these calculations. So by all means you could go that route and learn to do this yourself or we have a spreadsheet mastery course that actually comes with this same exact spreadsheet. And this spreadsheet is plug and play meaning all you have to do is enter the pair, time, date, stop loss, target one and target two and everything else is calculated for you plus you have an adjustable starting balance. So let's say you have a $50,000 account, it automatically adjusts for that account balance or if you even have a $500 account it will automatically adjust for that balance. Also an adjustable risk proposition for you to calculate your risk management and money management plan. If you're a little more risk tolerant you could put 2% in that box and that would adjust every calculation accordingly to that percentage. If you're a little less risk tolerant you could only do a half percent per position and everything is adjusted accordingly. So as you can see this is a pretty powerful spreadsheet and again the spreadsheet mastery course does come with this exact spreadsheet as well as a full seven video training series that will show you the functions and formulas necessary to create a spreadsheet like this and we'll actually walk through creating the same exact spreadsheet in that course. So if you're interested in that links in the description below but if not then that's fine too you can absolutely figure out all of this on your own. It does take a little bit longer. So for those of you who want to save some time again that link is in the description labeled spreadsheet mastery course. But guys that's pretty much all the calculations you need in order to find your edge over the market and figure out whether or not a strategy is going to be profitable. So I would definitely figure out how to create a spreadsheet that's capable of these kind of calculations somehow. And when you do so it will tremendously speed up your back testing process and make back testing much much easier. So now let's go ahead and take a look at how you can actually create an equity curve chart in an Excel spreadsheet. So in order to do this you will find a chart button for me to write up here at the top and it looks like a pie graph circling it now. And you can do this one of two ways. You can either click that button that's labeled chart and then identify the range of numbers you want to calculate in the equity curve or the way I normally do it is just drag down the columns you want to base the equity curve on. So we'll go ahead and do the column that is the gain and loss percentage column. So this will give us an equity curve based on the percentage gained in the account and show us what our drawdowns look like and what our equity return looks like in a visual format on a graph. So just drag down all those numbers and then click your little pie chart up there. Once you do that I normally go to the line and go ahead and click lines only and smooth that out. Then you can just click finish. You can come over here to this right side of the equity curve and go ahead and delete the column K. You can adjust the size by the little dots on the equity curve. And of course you can adjust the position by dragging the equity curve up or down. And there we have our equity curve. Now in order to adjust the axis just hover over the axis, axis being the X and Y axis of the equity curve we're going to take the X axis, go to format axis positioning and we're actually going to put that on the outside start. What that's going to do is put it on the bottom so those numbers aren't coming across right there at the zero percent. Instead they'll be down here at the very bottom. I like that a little bit better. If you'd like to adjust your Y axis then you just hover over the Y axis, go to format axis. Let's say you want to have a Y axis that shows you every 10 percent gained or lost on the account. Then you just go to scale. Right here it says automatic at major interval, automatic. You can uncheck that from automatic and go ahead and put in 10 percent there and hit okay. And as you can see now you can see every 10 percent with a horizontal line here on your equity curve. Now we can also add a title to the equity curve. All you have to do is click anywhere on the equity curve outside of the chart. Click insert titles and name it. We'll just call this EAP equity curve. And as you can see there's our title. And now if you want to customize the colors of the chart or the colors of the line in the chart you can just click on the chart itself. Right click, go to format wall area. I like to choose gradient and you can pick from any of these colors. So for me I like the sunburst and I like to change the line here to black instead of blue. So now we have a professional looking equity curve with a title with a customized color scheme and you can play around with this and change the colors of the background and you can go back to 20 percent over here on our y-axis. That's actually what I like better. So we're going to go to scale and move this back to 20. And as I said it's extremely simple to come out here and change the background of your equity curve. Just right click, click format wall and pick whatever colors you would like. And guys now that we're in here I'm actually going to show you how to pick a different data range for your equity curve. So this equity curve is based on a data range and that data range is the numbers we've selected right up here. The numbers that are in blue right in here, this column of numbers is our data range. So if you wanted to change that you could click the line, right click, go down here data ranges, click this little box that says select data range. Once you do that scroll up and you can choose a different range of data. So let's say you want to do your total account pips or your total account caps. Let's do total account cash. We just start there and go ahead and drag that all the way down. And now I have to adjust a few things like our Y axis. And instead of zero being the minimum for the Y axis we'll go ahead and make that right here where it says minimum you can change that. We'll change it to 9000 because our account never went under 9000. Our major intervals I would rather that be a thousand. And there we have a much cleaner and better looking chart with that different range of numbers. Now we're plotting this equity curve based on the total amount of cash gained or lost in the account instead of based on the total percentage gained or lost. So that's how you could pick a different range of numbers to calculate the equity curve from. So traders that is creating an equity curve chart in an Excel spreadsheet. And that is all the calculations you'll need a spreadsheet to make for you in order to determine if you have an edge over the market or not based on your back testing results. And again guys if you're interested in learning more about formulas and functions and how to create a spreadsheet that's exactly like this one. Or if you're just interested in getting your hands on this exact spreadsheet to be able to plug in your back testing results and find your edge over the market or adjust the risk proposition in order to create a risk or money management plan. Then the link to the spreadsheet mastery course is in the description below. And we're currently offering a half off discount for the first 100 people to sign up for that course. So if you click the link in the description and head over there quickly you can actually get this entire course for under 100 bucks which in my opinion is an incredible value. I've seen similar spreadsheets go for anywhere between 500 and a thousand dollars. So make sure to check that out if you're interested. And we also have a training program for struggling traders that is more chart based and technical analysis based. So if you'd like to try out the EAP training program you can also find that link in the description below.
