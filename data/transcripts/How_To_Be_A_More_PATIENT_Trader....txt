I can tell you things that can inspire you to be patient, but inspiration does not last that long. Have you ever been inspired to lose weight or inspired to gain muscle and get big? If you have, then you know that that inspiration might last a week or two. What changes your body literally is not you watching videos on YouTube about working out, thinking about working out, thinking about losing weight. It's the actions and habits that you actually do. Those are the things that will change your body. And in terms of becoming a more patient trader, it's the actions and habits you take. It's not asking your mentor how to be more patient. Asking questions isn't going to do it. It's not having the idea that you want to be more patient. It's right at the point when you're about to make a decision that you know is not the right decision. When you're about to take targets off early, it's right before you make that decision and click that button. Thinking, are these the actions and habits of a patient and professional trader? If they are not, then do not do them.
