What we're gonna be looking for a reason to go short on this pair right up here at this level So if the market pushes up just a little bit higher than we'll be looking at the 1.1686 area for Resistance we're looking to get a shorting opportunity for trend continuation on this pair as you can see this pair has been breaking Support levels now putting us into a reversal and into a new downtrend here only euro dollar daily chart So as I said if we get that push up to the 1.1686 zone We'll be looking for a reason to short this market for trend continuation all the way down to the 1.14 5-3 zone that's the first place we'll be looking for support out of this market and a counter trend trade if we break below that level We'll be looking at the 1.13 even handle for our next level of possible support now There is a situation where this market could break above the 1.1686 level if that happens We'll be looking at that level as support and we'll be looking at our next resistance around the 1.1872 zone And our next resistance above that at our previous highest highs around the 1.2060 level looking left right here So as for the immediate future only euro dollar really paying attention to this level right here to see if we can get some Opportunities out of the market in this level throughout the rest of this week now next up Let's go ahead and move on to the Aussie dollar So here on the Aussie dollar we have this level of support at 0.7631 This is a level of support we talked about in last week's video now This market has hovered around this level for a while put in some consolidation right here in this zone and finally We have actually broken through that level with this candle now this very next candle is very important to me I want to see if this market continues in that trend closes below this blue line yet again Or do we close back above the blue line if we close back above the blue line? Then I'll still be looking at this level as support But the more likely scenario is that the market actually breaks through this level because of how many times it's been tested and the market Was unable to put any kind of real rally up to break above our previous support levels or even to our next resistance level So because of that we're expecting this market to continue in this downward direction And we're just waiting for more confirmation on this next candle here on the Aussie dollar now if we get that confirmation Let's say this candle closes right down here Then we'll be waiting for a move all the way down to 0.7584 as our first level of support and that will turn the 0.7631 level into our first level of resistance If the market breaks above that we'll be looking at the 0.7735 level as our next level of resistance and finally above that is 0.7819 as our final level of resistance here on the Aussie dollar Now we'll go ahead and zoom the chart out and find one more level of support here for this pair So let's zoom out and see if we can find a spot that's been touched multiple times and respected multiple times by this market The first level that stands out to me is right in here And the reason is because this level was used as support by the market multiple times in through here You can call this being used as resistance right through here Resistance again here and then support once more here So that level could if the market decides to break through these levels act as support once again And that's gonna be the place we start looking for some buying opportunities if we get a really big move down out of the Aussie dollar Right around the 0.7534 level So as for the immediate future here only Aussie dollar will wait to see if this candle confirms that this level has been broken by closing below the level once more down here or if we close back above it and we can start looking for some kind of buying Opportunity above that level here on the Aussie dollar and we've already mentioned the other levels of support and resistance that we'll be paying a Tidget to throughout the rest of this week So let's go ahead and move on to our next pair before we do guys if I sound a little raspy It's because I've been a little bit sick throughout the week That's also the reason that this video is coming out a bit late So I do apologize for that, but I did want to get this content out to you guys So I decided to go ahead and push through it and create this video anyway But anyways the next pair we're gonna take a look at is gonna be the dollar yen So here on the dollar yen last week we talked again about the 114.23 level this level right here as being major resistance and last week's video We talked about if the market pushed down from that resistance level would be looking for shorting opportunities on a lower time frame So let's go ahead and go down to a lower time frame and take a look at what we have looking at the four-hour chart here And do you guys notice anything about this chart? Well, something interesting that I know is after this push below our daily level of resistance at 114.23 that we pointed out last week We then have another breaking close Below our previous support level and then yet again a breaking close below our previous support level. What's that telling us? Well, that's telling us that we could have a possible reversal here This this trend previously was in the upward direction and now we've had multiple breaks of previous support Telling me that we are in a possible reversal situation So what we're gonna be looking at is a possible reason to go short as a reversal trade from somewhere in this area right around This previous support level and we actually pointed this out in last week's video So if you want to check that out I'll put a link in the description to last week's video as well as in the top right hand corner of the screen where you can see our Full breakdown of the dollar yen from last week But as for the immediate future on the dollar yen We'll be looking for some kind of shorting opportunity and some type of shorting entry reason in order to catch Or some trend continuation and ride this market all the way down to the 111.79 area Let's zoom back out to the daily chart and take a look at the other areas that will be paying attention to for support and resistance on this pair So our other major levels of structure here on the dollar yen if we do push up instead of down Then we'll be looking yet again at the 114.23 area as resistance if we get above that area then 114.95 around the 115 even handle will be the next level resistance that we look for a counter Trend opportunity from now if we push down as we expect Then we'll be looking to short the market all the way down to the 111.79 area That's the level we'll be taking a look at for counter trend trading opportunities if we push below that We'll be looking at 110.73 as our next level of counter trend possible trading So that's gonna do it for the dollar yen Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair which will be the pound dollar the pound dollar has been in a period of consolidation For a little over a month now between the 1.325 area Of resistance that we have pointed out and the 1.30 5 6th level that we've pointed out in previous weeks as well So the market right now using those two levels the 1.325 level right up here as resistance and this 1.30 5 6th level as support so where the market sits right now we have no trade as for the immediate future out of the pound dollar if Anything we will wait for this market to either push down and get really close to our 1.30 5 6th level And try to find some kind of trading opportunity on a smaller time frame to ride this market back up to resistance as long as we stay in Consolidation and then we'll be looking for a shorting opportunity from this resistance level and that's what we're looking for as for the immediate future And as for this coming week here on the pound dollar now as for a little bit further out if we do break down Past the 1.30 5 6th level we'll be looking at support at 1.28 5 0 That'll be the first level we look for a buying opportunity and if we break up past the 1.3237 level then our next level resistance We'll be the 1.3441 Area and above that we'll be looking at 1.35 974 resistance here on the pound dollar So not much to talk about here on the pound dollar really just a waiting game to see if this market will pull back down Into our 1.30 5 6 support level or push all the way up to Around the 1.325 area for resistance and that's what we'll be watching out for here on the pound dollar throughout this week So now let's go ahead and move on to our last pair the dollar Swiss on the dollar Swiss We had this nice break above our previous structure levels right in here last week We were waiting on a pullback down into that level Well, we got that pullback and then some we got a little bit deeper of a pullback down below our 0.99 5 7 support level we had pointed out and now the market seems to have rallied back above that level That's a pretty good sign. So we'll be now looking around this level For a possible long opportunity It's pretty obvious why I would be looking for a long opportunity out of this pair as the most recent trend has been up with the market Making new highs and new higher lows all the way up to its current position So what I'm looking at this as is just another higher low So that's what we're looking for as for the immediate future this pullback here has given us an opportunity to take a possible long trade Somewhere in this area will be looking on lower timeframes for some kind of entry reason out of the dollar Swiss to go long From the 0.9957 support level if the market does get support from this level and pushes up the next level We'll look at for a counter trend opportunity is around 1.0089 And that's also an area we can look for shorting opportunities and if we push above that area We'll look at 1.01 674 next counter trend short opportunities Now if the market breaks below this level and continues lower Then we'll be looking at the 0.9873 level as our next level of possible support to continue this uptrend if we break below that Once more we look at the 0.9740 level as our next level support and our next level for some buying opportunities out of the dollar Swiss So that's what we're looking at on the dollar Swiss and that's our predictions for the top five major pairs We do a video like this each Monday pointing out our predictions on each of these top five pairs So if you're interested in being alerted when those videos come out then you can one subscribe to the channel here at the trading channel Also head over and sign up for our email list to make sure you're alerted first whenever we come out with these 4x weekly market prediction videos And also any other free educational content that we provide here on YouTube now if you sign up for the email list That's not all you'll be getting you also will receive a free butterfly pattern tutorial along with free structure training And other free trainings that we don't offer here on YouTube other than that guys make sure you're subscribed here Make sure you go ahead and click that like button for me If you got value out of this content and share it with a friend to help support the channel If you're someone who is just starting out or if you've been struggling for a while as a trader and you're ready to invest in your trading Education that we do have a paid program called the EAP and this is a program that's helped many traders already achieve Their goal of being a professional and independently profitable trader I get emails every day from clients who have not only enjoyed the program But tell me that the program has helped them on their path to trading success So guys if you're ready to invest in your trading education and take that next step towards profitability Then there's a special 20% off discount link in the description for the EAP training program And if not then I would just highly suggest that you dive into our YouTube channel and check out all the free information that we offer here We have over a hundred videos here on the trading channel ranging everywhere from structure analysis and advanced patterns to simple patterns And trading psychology so dive into those as well and I'll talk to you guys in the next video
