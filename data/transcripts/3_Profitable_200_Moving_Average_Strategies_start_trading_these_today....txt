See you soon. Good. Before we jump into the charts I wanted to quickly tell you that the chart is going to be that our pre Black Friday event is now live. Essentially this event gives you the chance to get every course or program that I've ever made or ever will make for the cheapest price that we've ever done. So if you are interested in learning more about that then it's the first link in the description or go to thetradychannel.org slash Black Friday sale. Now let's jump into these charts. So first off the 200 period moving average is not going to have any magic tricks up its sleeve. So if you're talking about that this moving average by itself is not really going to mean much but when combined with the right price action techniques it can create some really accurate trading opportunities. And today I'm going to teach you three ways to do that starting with way number one which is you use the 200 moving average for trend identification during breakout pullback and price action trades. The second way we are going to learn how to use the 200 period moving average today is to use it as a major level of support or resistance. And third you're going to learn how to use the 200 moving average as a reversal signal in long term trends. So if that sounds good then we'll go ahead and get started with number one. So number one how do we use the 200 moving average in order to trade pullbacks breakouts and price action patterns. Well for anyone who is a pro trader they're probably going to be looking at just structure and trend right. Trend levels then structure levels to be hit trend level structure level to be hit. I'm talking previous support turned to resistance resistance turned to support areas of supply and demand but if you're someone who's just starting out then that all probably sounded extremely confusing. So what you are going to do if you're just starting out is simply add a 50 period moving average to the screen. This is going to qualify your pullback. So the rules I have for a strategy like this would be I'm waiting for price to be under the 200 moving average. I'm then waiting for price to pullback while under that 200 moving average to at least touch the 50 period moving average and that is when I considered that I have a pullback. Everything in between is not something I'm paying attention to so I would be going swing high here. I'm actually cleaning this up a little bit for you guys. Swing high here down to swing low here and then I would be trading this pullback once we touch the 50 moving average. Now I'll tell you how I'm going to be doing that a little later in the video. Then we pull down I'm going from this swing high now to this swing low and I'm waiting on that pullback that at least touches the 50 period moving average. So what are we really doing here is we are taking advantage of deep retracements and deep pullbacks while the market is in an overall downtrend in this situation considering that price is below the 200 moving average. So we have price below the 200 moving average deeply retracing to the 50 period moving average and as it does so what we're doing is creating a zone between the two. So the qualifications that I have is I'm waiting on a new low out of price. Then I'm waiting while price obviously is under the 200 moving average. But I'm waiting on that pullback to the 50 and after I get the pullback to the 50 I'm waiting on a certain candlestick pattern or a certain price action pattern on lower time frames to enter. I only get one chance at this. So I have my let's say I get an entry right here. I do not get to enter again until we either break in the new lows or break in the new lows and then get another touch of the 50 EMA or the 50 period moving average. What I mean by this is if this market would have went from this low came up here gave me let's actually do this real close up. So this market we have all the rules met we're trading under the 200. We get a pullback to the 50 and we get this shooting star green candle right here that for me would be a really good trade. So I might take an entry on the close of that candle with a stop loss right up here and a target as a trained in an equation target would be something like a two to one with that being the case. What I mean by I only get one shot of this is that if this market continued higher here and stop me out I would not get the trade again until we either break above the 200 and start a new uptrend or until this market came down and broke below the latest low that was created. That's the only way I get another trade this way I only lose one trade when the market starts to reverse because at times the market will reverse instead of just hitting that 50 period moving average in a pullback and then pushing down so that would look like this right here we have a market is pushing down right as we push down let's say we got an entry on this shooting star we push down again we got lower lows so now I can wait for another pullback and here ironically we get another shooting star right at the 50 period moving average we get another push down breaking into new lows we pull up here we get an engulfing candle okay with that being the case I might have entered the market there got stopped out right here with that being the case I cannot enter again until the market either breaks this low or moves into a new uptrend past our 200 period moving average so that's how we're going to use the 200 period moving average for pullback type trades and what I'll do is go over a couple of bullish examples now so if the market reverses like it just did we get a move up we get a move higher we're now trading above this 200 moving average or black line what am I waiting on for pullback trades well in the bullish example I'll be waiting on the market to pull down enough to at least touch the 50 period moving average and then give me a hammer looking candle kind of like this one is some type of buying pressure whether that be a candlestick pattern or a price action pattern on lower time frames and I would be placing a trade based on that so as we continue here we're waiting on the market to create new highs new pullbacks that touch the 50 EMA and then give us an entry reason either on this time frame or a lower time frame the time frame in this case does not matter right now I want to four hour this stuff applies on every time frame so as we continue what would be our next trade what we would push up breaking a new highs pullback to our 50 period moving average we consider that now a valid pullback because we're looking for these deeper pullbacks to the 50 and then we'd be looking for trading opportunities here and on lower time frames that is exactly how I use the 200 period moving average for pullback trades and that's how I would suggest you use it if you are a beginner now let's dive into how we would use this for breakout trades potential breakout trades well we would take the 50 off the 50 period moving average off and what I would be doing is waiting for the market to consolidate while below or above the 200 period moving average and breakout right it's breakout trades or wait no breakouts the way I do that is every low that's created like this one here after that low is created I'll put a horizontal line on the bodies of that low what I'm waiting on is priced to touch that horizontal line and give me at least two green candles pushing up to green candles if it does then I count this as a period of consolidation because it's a support level that's been tested twice after that I'll wait for the breakout I'll give you a good example of this right now what happens after we create this low we get a pullback and a break of that low once we get the break of this low the next thing I'm gonna do is just move my horizontal line down to the next low but I'm talking about the next lowest bodies not the next low as in the low of the candle wake the next lowest bodies here we get a break below and a close below here so that's not consolidation but as I push down to the next lowest bodies which are right here now what do we have we have a level of structure that's been tested one two and three times therefore I would keep my line this is how I trade breakouts I would keep my line on the lowest bodies not on the lowest week but on the lowest bodies where I originally have my line at right now and I would wait on that breakout candle and a pullback and then continuation of that trade or another way to trade this would be waiting on the breakout candle using the candle itself for a stop above it and then having targets set appropriately according to what you would like your targets to be but those are a couple of ways you could trade break out let's see what would happen if we continue to do that nothing nothing here's our next opportunity the reason is we have brand new lows right here was our previous highs we pushed down into new lows we now have our horizontal line on the bodies of those lows we see that they get hit once twice and then broken and closed below so at this point I would have an entry there stop loss above there and a target set accordingly and that's how we would be using breakouts in a bearish or short example let's talk about the bullish example here so using our 200 moving average for breakout trades again we're looking for highs in price that have been hit multiple times so we can consider them consolidation and when I say highs I'm talking about the highs of the bodies so here you cannot consider this consolidation here not consolidation here only one red candle pushing down unfortunately not consolidation and we don't get consolidation pushing up again until right here so we have a high then we have consolidation after this next high our breakout candles right here and this was a losing trade but guess what that's totally fun sometimes you lose trades it's just a part of trading as we continue here but that is exactly how I would use the 200 moving average for potential breakout trades using this moving average to tell me the direction I need to be taking those breakout trades and using the set and stone rules of needing two highs to be touched to consider it bullish consolidation waiting on the breakout or at least two lows or more to be touched to consider it a bearish or shorting breakout to the downside now in terms of using the 200 moving average for price action patterns what do you think we're going to be doing this one's kind of self-explanatory right we're going to be waiting on things like double tops which you can see right here one top two top the reason that's classified as a double top we have a push up push back down double top market moves to the downside this would be exactly what we're trading the only advice I would have for this is to make sure your double tops at least have a red candle afterwards because you want to see bearish momentum coming after the double top so we're looking for a double top with a red candle or a double bottom with a green candle let's keep looking here on the chart I haven't went through this chart by the way guys I'm just looking around to see if I can see trades so it seems a little jumbled that is why but at this point I do not see any other double tops yet and we don't get any double tops let's check for double bottoms here we go pushing pushing pushing no double bottoms it took me a second here to find a bullish example but here we have a bullish example the market pushing in a new high is pulling back on this pullback we want to see a price action pattern what price action pattern is that it is going to be a double bottom that has a green candle after it to show momentum and then we take the market long an expectation of this to continue to the high side so that is how I use the 200 average in order to spot pullback trades price action pattern trades and breakout trades next up let's talk about how to use the 200 moving average for levels of support and resistance so for support and resistance it's pretty clear what we're looking for is the 200 moving average to act as major support this lines up and works best I'm not going to go over this that much because it's quite simple right you see the market coming into the 200 moving average after a long period of time of not touching the 200 moving average that's a good sign that this level is going to be a strong resistance level now that's not normally enough what is though is adding that with a major level of structure support or resistance so here we have a major level of support that could turn to resistance we then have the market trending below the 200 moving average and coming back up into that 200 moving average while also coming into that major zone when you combine those two normally you can get really accurate support and resistance out of the 200 moving average let me give you another example here but a bullish example here we have a market that pushed up starts to trend above the 200 moving average pulls back to that 200 moving average and then what do we do we look left to see is that in a major level of structure while coming off of the 200 moving average yes it is the market is higher of course that will not happen every single time it's just something that can give an advantage and can make for some really accurate trading opportunities so that's about as much as you need to know about support and resistance using the 200 moving averages we're looking for the moving average itself to act as support and resistance but we also want to look left and make sure that that support or resistance lines up with a major level of structure when I say that I mean we want to make sure the 200 moving average lines up with a major level of structure let me see if I can find one more example for you guys here we have an example again that probably was a losing trade but let's put a horse on a line here does this line up with a major level of structure looking left we have a really minor level here but no not really we don't really have a major level and that's why we didn't see that big of a bounce out of this market from there so let's continue now and talk about how we use the 200 moving average as a reversal signal and this is where I'm going to share an actual rules based strategy with you guys for reversals if a market makes it all the way to and crosses above the 200 moving average there's a pretty good chance that we're going to see either consolidation or we're going to see this market reverse so how do we capitalize on that well what I like to do and this was a really good example of the exact trading strategy that I want to teach you right now I like to wait on the cross of the 200 moving average this would be considered the cross of the 200 moving average I want to see that at least five candles do not touch the moving average at all okay so here we have the first candle that didn't touch the moving average two three four five after I have at least five candles that do not touch the moving average I'm waiting on the market to pull back to the 200 moving average and produce a candlestick pattern if that happens I'm taking the entry on that candlestick pattern with a stop below the swing low and a target back up at resistance that normally gives about a 1.5 to a two to one risk reward on trades like this so let's go over a bearish version of this as well so here we have a bearish version of this strategy I'd be looking for the market that was previously in an uptrend to now break below the 200 moving average once that happens I start counting candles as they stop touching the moving average this was the first candle that did not touch the 200 moving average so I have 1 2 3 4 5 so as I get five candles I'm waiting on a pullback to the 200 moving average this pullback must touch the 200 moving average and then I'm waiting on a candlestick pattern like this shooting star now in this case the risk reward was not quite there this was just a very good example of exactly what I would be looking for with this type of strategy so let's go ahead and do this and take a stop loss right about there and see if we even got a one to one but at one point one which normally again you get a little better than that on this type of trading strategy in this case I thought a one to one risk reward we'll take a look at one more example if I can find it really quickly right here is a good example of this we're waiting on a market and another important part of this factor is that the market needs to previously have been in a downtrend classify that how you want to but I want to see that the market has a lot of space between price and the 200 moving average for a long period of time if that's the case then I'm waiting on a reversal a reversal looks something like this for me I have a market that crosses above the 200 moving average here we've crossed but we only have one two three candles and then we touch the 200 here so I can't take a trade there and the process starts over and I go okay well what about now now we have one two three four five so now I can wait on the market to touch the 200 and give me a candlestick pattern like this close above candle and I can do something like this have my entry there my stop below that candle and a target either back up at previous resistance again this one goes about a one to one you could have taken targets higher however you want to take targets on this is totally fine I just said structure because that's more of a beginner friendly way to do it for me as you probably know if you've been watching my channel for a while I normally no matter where structure is just use a 1.4 to one risk reward some people will not agree with that but it's something that works for me really well so that is how you would use the 200 EMA for possible reversal signals and that was three different ways to use the 200 EMA to gain advantage and an edge over the market and three different ways and a few different ways to create accurate trading opportunities based on that now take all of this information combine it the way you want to and do not trade it yeah you heard me right do not trade it you need to take it and back test it what that means scroll your chart back as far as it will go go all the way to the beginning of the data that you have and once you decide what you want to do whether you're trading the pullback strategy that bounces off of something like the 50 period moving average you have the price above 200 you have the 50 on there to identify the fact that we have a deep retracement and you choose to take trades off of that based on price action of whatever kind you choose what you will need to do in that case is scroll all the way back to the beginning of your data and test every single time that rule was met look how far back I'm going why because you need to know what the possible drawdown is of that strategy just as important you need to know that that strategy makes money over long periods of time just as important as that you need to have confidence in this strategy enough to last through the inevitable periods of drawdown that it will have so what you would do is go back and test this strategy through historic data yourself I can't do the work for you all I can do is produce content like this that I believe will help you to gain an advantage over the market that will help you create a better risk management plan and it will help you create the mindset you need to be a profitable trader that's all I can do I can't do the work for you so take this knowledge go test it see
