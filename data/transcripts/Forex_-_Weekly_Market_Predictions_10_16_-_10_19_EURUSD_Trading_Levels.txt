We talked about in last week's video as being an area of resistance in the trade You see on your screen was based on last week's forex market predictions video and guys that's the reason I think these videos are so valuable because I'm actually showing you guys the exact places that I'm looking for trading opportunities from So we talked about this level being a level we were looking for a trading opportunity from in last week's video And I'm gonna play you guys a short clip where we are discussing buying opportunities from this level and shorting opportunities from this top Level here in red in last week's video for those of you who did not see that or just as a recap for those who did see it So let's check those clips out and I'll be right back Of course We have the zone that we pointed out last week that the markets currently around which is the 1.1665 zone So level will be looking at for possible buying opportunities throughout this week and in the immediate future If this market pushes up from the level where at right now our first stop for resistance and for a possible shorting opportunity is around 1.1875 that's where we'll be looking at for any type of sign that the market wants to move lower So that we can take advantage of that to the downside So traders we ended up with a nice bounce off of this level here That we talked about in last week's video and then we moved right up to this next level of major structure that we were talking About in that video and we had a nice push down from this level now on the daily chart I know this does not look like much But if we zoomed down to a four-hour time frame This was actually a little over a hundred pips we made so far on the first part of our position here only your dollar As you can see we ended up pushing up to these levels We got a nice entry reason out of this pair and so far we've been able to hit our first targets pushing down But something that's important to note is what has already happened here on the four-hour chart that level resistance has now been broken This level of resistance has now been broken because of that this market has reversed trend previously for this pair We were in a downtrend consistently making these lower lows And lower highs well now we've broken above those two resistance levels created a higher high and it's quite possible that we see a Higher low so for us we've already taken off that first part of our position We're currently sitting with our stop loss at break even so even if this market does reverse and push up Continuing this new uptrend we have here on the four-hour time frame We managed to make some profit out of this trade and if this market Continues lower based on the daily chart based on this level of resistance We have found then we can continue to profit from the second part of this position And something that I'm hoping this will help you understand is the fact that when the market got to this level I did not know for a fact that we were gonna push down I had no 100% certainty that the market was gonna push lower from that level It's not about knowing what the market's gonna do. It's about the preparation you have before you place the trade It's about having a set of conditions match with a set of entry reasons that tell you when to trade and that give you an advantage over the market and You can test that advantage in a process called back testing throughout historical data Along with a process called forward testing in a fake account And if you're someone who has done neither of those two things then it might be time to stop trading for now Go through those two processes first make sure you have an edge over the market so that you can consistently place trades Based on the conditions and rules you've created to make your process of becoming a profitable trader much easier So that's what we were looking at last week here on the euro dollar Let's go ahead and make some decisions about what we can expect next out of this pair So as we just talked about we could see trend continuation here on the daily chart as we push further down We could also see trend continuation on that four-hour time frame where this market pushes up if one of those two things happen We are prepared the way we are prepared is if the market pushes back down The 1.168 six level. That's a place. We'll look for some long opportunities out of this market And if this market continues to push up We'll be looking at the 1.2060 level as our first level to look for some shorting opportunities out of this pair And if we push up and break through that level then the 1.2295 level will be our next stop for shorting opportunities First support if we do continue lower breaking through the 1.168 six zone Then we'll look for our next buying opportunity down here at 1.1453 That's a level where we can look for some type of reason to go long and that's some of the things we will look for here throughout the next few Weeks on the euro dollar. So now that we've talked a little bit about euro dollar We can move on to our next pair which is going to be the Aussie dollar Let's go ahead and take a look at that pair on the daily chart. All right, so here we are on the Aussie dollar last week on this pair We talked about this level 0.7735 level being a possible place for support out of this market And we did get a nice bounce off that level personally We were waiting on another pullback to get a little closer to that zone before we could take a long position that never happened So we ended up not being able to get involved although We did point out this level as a key level of structure support up next We talked about this as being our next level resistance as you can see the market blew right past that level never did Give us any kind of entry reason so we weren't able to go short from there But now this market has pushed up into our next level of resistance based on this higher time frame chart at 0.7 893 so that's going to be something interesting to keep an eye on for the rest of the week Maybe we'll get a nice little pullback up into that level and an entry reason to go short out of this Aussie dollar pair But for now we have to change the color of this line to blue and let's talk about what we could expect out of this pair throughout the rest This week as we just said we could expect a possible move back up into 0.7893 At that levels where we could look for a Possible shorting opportunity if the market breaks above that level the next level of major structure We have out here on the day they charge a 0.8023 and that'll be the next level We look for shorting opportunities out of the Aussie dollar There's also a possibility that this market comes back into 0.7815 if that happens we will be looking for long opportunities out of this pair This is the optimal trade for the week for this week I'll be looking for a move back into this area to see if I can get some type of long Opportunity from here because this market did just break but this little resistance level here on the daily chart putting us into a possible Up trend and this would be the optimal place to tag along for that uptrend now if the market does push down even lower than that We can look yet again for another long opportunity down at 0.7735 In that zone. So that's a few things we'll be looking for out of the Aussie dollar for this week Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. What is it gonna be the pound dollar? So here on the pound dollar we had a similar situation to the Aussie dollar where we had a nice bounce off of the support level But we were looking for another pullback in order to get long So because of that we didn't get an opportunity to actually go long off this pair But in last week's video We also pointed this out as a place where we would be looking for a shorting opportunity and down on a smaller timeframe We actually did get a shorting opportunity from this area that managed to hit our first targets We'll take a look at that in a bit But for now let's go ahead and talk about what we can expect throughout the rest of this week here on the pound dollar First off we need to go ahead and change this line to blue because the market has pushed above it at this point And now it will be acting as support not resistance So it's possible that we see this market push up this week if we do that Then we'll be looking at the 1.3441 area as a level of resistance to take a shorting opportunity out of the pound dollar And if we push up above that zone we'll be looking at the 1.3597 Area as the next level for shorting opportunity here on this pair looking at these previous highs back here Now this more here could also pull back into our most previous broken structure level right here around the 1.323 area That'll be a level we look for for a long opportunity here out of the pound dollar And if we break below that we can look at the 1.3056 zone for buying opportunities here out of the pound dollar Throughout the rest of this week and probably over the next couple of weeks. So that's what we'll be looking for this week out of the pound dollar Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair. What's gonna be the dollar Swiss? The dollar Swiss is now pushed down into a level of structure We talked about last week we talked about this level as being a possible level that could support this market Reason being because of all the times we have seen support and resistance out of the same level in the past Look right here. You can see this level exit is resistance multiple times So that leads us to believe that we could see a nice bounce off this level And that's something we'll be paying attention to for the remainder of this week We'll be looking for some buying opportunities here out of the dollar Swiss in this zone now If we do get those buying opportunities out of this level the next key level of structure will be looking at to Take off targets and to possibly go short here on the dollar Swiss is at the 0.9873 zone after that if we break above that level We're looking at 0.9974 is our next level of counter-trans shorting opportunity There's also a situation where this market breaks through the 0.974 level in that case that level will become Resistance and we'll be looking at support around the 0.9628 zone if we break below that zone We're looking at 0.958 in that zone for buying opportunities here on the dollar Swiss So that's the things we'll be looking for here out of the dollar Swiss throughout the remainder of this week and into the next couple of weeks So go ahead and move on to our final pair of the day We're just gonna be the dollar yen our traders so here we're on that dollar yen pair and we're actually floating around a level of structure We talked about in last week's video for a possible trade to the upside. We're floating around a possible buying opportunity zone here on this pair So for the immediate future on this pair we'll actually be looking for a buying entry reason since we are floating around the zone This zone means our conditions have been met and now we're gonna be waiting on our actual entry reason from this area to take this trade going Long now there is a situation where we do not get an entry reason going long and instead this market continues to push down If that is the case then we'll be looking at the 110.73 zone is a possible buying opportunity And if we continue even lower than that our next level we'll be looking for a buying opportunity is 108.97 Now if we get that nice push up from this level of structure support that we're hoping for then in that case We'll be looking for a selling opportunity around the 114 even handle all the way up to the 114.18 Area if that zones a place we can look for a counter trend shorting opportunity out of the dollar yen If we break above that level then around the 115 even handle is our next spot for a possible shorting opportunity So those are some things we're expecting here out of the dollar yen That's what we're expecting on these top five major pairs here in the 4x market I hope this information was valuable to you if it was go ahead and click that like button for us help support the channel If you're new do not forget to go ahead and subscribe here to the trading channel to be alerted when we come out with other valuable Contents such as these weekly market prediction videos that come out every Monday Remember that the key is not to know exactly what the market's gonna do But is to be prepared for every situation the market could throw you and the way you get prepared for that is by creating a plan Create an actual organized plan that tells you when you can place trades in the market And a trading plan is gonna go much further than that and much beyond that all the way into risk management money management and other more advanced aspects of trading if you've been trying to trade for a while and it just has not worked and you don't want to continue the path of Slowly draining accounts, but instead you'd like to invest in your education in the 4x market Then we do offer a paid program called the EAP the email analysis program If you want to learn more about that program and learn more about how some other traders have used the things they've learned in that program to become profitable Already then you just click the link in the description labeled EAP training program If not, and that's okay to just keep watching the valuable content We have here on YouTube and I'm sure that your trading will improve We also offer other free educational content that we do not provide here on YouTube And you can find out more about that by clicking the link in the description labeled free training email list to join our email list over the trading channel net and have access to Free training such as a free butterfly pattern tutorial and free structure based trading lessons So that's gonna do it for this week's edition of weekly market predictions I wish you guys the best of luck on your future trades leave me a comment if you have any questions about today's video And I'll talk to you guys in the next one You
