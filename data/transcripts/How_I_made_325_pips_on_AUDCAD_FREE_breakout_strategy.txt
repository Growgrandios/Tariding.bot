Hey traders and welcome to the trading channel. My name is Stephen and I am the owner and head trader at the trading channel.net. A trading education website helping traders just like you become consistently profitable. In today's video we're going to discuss the analysis behind the Aussie Canada trade that I posted on trading view a few days ago. And this trade has proven to be extremely profitable hitting our first and second targets. And I actually have a third part of the position continuing to roll and currently that third part of the position is up around 180 pips in profit. So if I click the play button here and load up some new bars you can see how this trade played out. As you can see easily coming up to hit our first target and second target. And now this market continuing to rise which is what we assumed it would do based on the technical analysis that I'm going to be sharing with you guys today.

Now this strategy until now has been exclusive to my EAP members only but over this weekend only I would like to offer you guys access to the same strategy that allowed me to take this breakout trade here on the dollar Swiss which hit first and second targets. And has now come down and almost stopped me out for break even on the third part of my position. And also another trade we were able to get involved in based on that strategy. And this is a trade that we actually did analysis on in the EAP is the dollar yen breakout trade. And if you would like access to this strategy there's a link in the description below this video labeled EAP breakout strategy. That's the link you need to click in order to get this breakout strategy for absolutely no cost. And in this video I'll be showing you the rules of that breakout strategy on this exact trade that you see here on the dollar yen.

This is the trade that I posted to Trading View and as for the EAP this trade was sent out as email analysis for the EAP and both targets have already been filled. The remainder of the position that you see on now is actually just for my personal account. I'm already completely out of position for the EAP first target winner of 41 pips and second target win of 101 pips. So this third part of the position that you see running is only in my personal trading. But if we go ahead and go over to my trading view you can see that this was an idea posted two days ago and I did briefly explain what I was looking at here on Trading View. But I do like to give more of a detailed explanation to you guys considering that you have taken precious time out of your day to watch some of these YouTube videos and you've decided to invest in yourself by spending time learning about Forex. So I'm going to give you a little more attention than I do people that just read through Trading View ideas. So as you can see we did have this higher time frame structure level indicated by my blue line, Daily Cypher Pattern, Double Bottom and RSI Divergence all coming together to give us a one to target winner. Now we'll head back to the charts and if I zoom out to the Daily Chart and show you guys this very nice Cypher Pattern and actually what I'm going to do guys is go ahead and delete all my analysis and then go ahead and delete all my analysis and then go ahead and delete all my analysis. And restart from the beginning showing you exactly what I was looking at. So I always start my analysis out here on the Daily Chart and on the Daily Chart I'm looking at a couple of different levels. Here you can see we have a nice little level of consolidation. If I put a couple of lines in here the consolidation level I'm talking about guys is right in through here. And considering that the market took up pretty long pause here for a number of days in between these two levels I know that the top and bottom of that level is something I want to pay attention to. And if we take a look a little bit further back you can see that that level on the top blue line there was tested not only once but a few different times. We have a test throughout this consolidation. We have another test here as resistance test here as resistance test here as support test here as support. So for me that signifies this blue line as a significant level of higher time frame structure. So now that I know that I know that when we get down to this line as we have now on the Aussie Canada I want to look for some long opportunities and give myself some reasons to go long on this pair. So now I have my bias in the market. Now I know that I'm not going to consider shorting opportunities once we get down to this line. So for that reason I've given myself a bias I've told myself the only trades I'm looking for are long opportunities and I know the exact level I want to look for those long opportunities. Now I need my reasons for entry and I can also put together a few different reasons to want to get involved in this level as I did for my analysis for trading view and for my EAP members. Now for the EAP the reasons for entry were completely different than the ones I posted on trading view because the EAP strategies are exclusive for EAP members. They just so happen to line up together the EAP strategy plus the technical indicators that I use in order to trade. So here if I bring all my extension tool from our previous swing though up to our swing high back down in. You can see that we don't quite close above that 1414. And if I bring all my retracement tool you can see that we get a 382 if I bring that up the rest of the way. So what kind of pattern do we have here guys we have a 382 retracement followed by that 127 extension that does not close above 1414 followed by a decompletion point at our 786. If you set cypher pattern then you would be correct. If I go ahead and draw this in for you guys make it a little easier to see. So now not only do we have that very significant level of daily structure we also have a cypher pattern completion at that same area. And I'll go ahead and draw my fibs for targets and put a green line at the 382. So for that 382 guys the position you still running for my personal trading the targets for that position are up here close to the 382 retracement on the daily chart. Now I knew that that was a risky place to put targets so I wanted to get my first and second target out of the way. And you might ask why is that a risky place? Well the reason is because we've just broke below this previous, let me move this out of the way sorry guys, this previous structure level here. This previous support was just broke below. So with that being the case I know that market may have a little bit of trouble getting back above that level so I want my first and second targets to be hit by then and my stop loss to be at break even. And that's exactly what we've done so far. And currently we're just waiting to see if this market can continue to go up and possibly hit that 382 cypher pattern target which would be the third target which would be the third target here on my Aussie Canada trade. So now that we have our higher time frame indications for why we would like to be involved in this trade we know that that's going to be a significant area for the market. We still don't place the trade directly based on this higher time frame. What I like to do is go down to a trading time frame which can consist of either the 4 hour, 1 hour or 15 minute charts. So we have come down to that daily level now on the 4 hour chart and we do get a little double bottom here. But the lower time frame you go to the less your stop loss is going to be and it is always good to have less risk in any trade. So instead of the 4 hour I decided to jump down to the 1 hour chart to see if we could find an opportunity there. And here on the 1 hour chart I noticed that we already had this very nice double bottom forming here and considering that we are at this cypher pattern completion or around the cypher pattern completion. We are around a daily level of significant structure. I already know my bias is long. An entry reason that I can use is a double bottom with bullish divergence on the RSI. So here we have our double bottom. I'll bring up the RSI here. You can see that here we have a low and if we go to our next low of this double bottom right here we have a higher low. What that is guys is RSI divergence. It's actually some really good RSI divergence and considering we are also oversold on that first touch we can count this as oversold RSI divergence all with a double bottom at a previous higher time frame structure and a daily cypher pattern completion. With all of those reasons for entry guys I decided to go ahead and go along on this pair and did manage to hit my first and second target. As I said earlier I am awaiting that 382 on the daily chart for the third part of my position but my stop is at break even and I've already made a good bit of profit on this trade. So guys hopefully by now you are starting to see how combining all the technical analysis that you've probably already learned and if you are new continue watching some of my YouTube videos make sure you are subscribed to be in front of me. I'm going to be in front of you guys and if you go back through the 30 or 40 YouTube videos that I already have a lot of the same analysis is taught throughout those videos and of course if you want more of a rules based trading plan approach to this that takes a little bit less technical analysis in order to perform then take advantage of that EAP half off promotion for your first month and you can take a look at the system I used in order to get involved in this trade. Alright guys so that was the analysis I used in order to get involved in the Aussie Canada trade. I hope you were able to learn something from that video if you did enjoy it please click that like button for me. For the remainder of this video I'm going to be talking about a couple of other trades that I was able to get involved in using that EAP breakout strategy that you can learn if you click the link in the description below this video labeled EAP breakout strategy and I'll also be discussing a little more about what you get if you decide to take advantage of that promotional offer for the EAP membership. So I'll go ahead and let that part of the video get started now. Welcome back traders. Alright so the first couple of trades we're going to take a look at is this flag pattern here on the dollar Swiss and we're also going to take a look at a dollar yen flag pattern and talk about the analysis we used to trade this in the EAP last week. Alright so here we'll start on the dollar Swiss and as you can see we have a very nice flag pattern and the reason I want to talk about these two trades first is because both of these trades were taken based on the breakout strategy that I used for the EAP. And up to this point that strategy has been exclusive to my EAP members but for a limited time I would like to offer you guys access to that strategy. So I'll briefly explain to you what you're getting for $20 in your first month. So with your purchase of the EAP program you'll receive email analysis on trades like this one, the dollar Swiss and dollar yen that you just saw. I'll head over to the email for the dollar yen trade quickly. As you can see here on the dollar yen I alerted traders that there was a breakout condition and if you'll read along with me very quickly here that the dollar yen is in breakout condition. This means that I'll be going down to the lower timeframes and to look for breakout trades using flags and triangles. And that's exactly what we did if we take a look here at the dollar yen. We went down to the one hour chart. After we realized we were in breakout condition and again to learn the rules of this strategy click the link to the EAP breakout strategy in the description below this video and it'll take you to a separate page. But we knew we were in the breakout condition and decided to take this breakout trade to the long side. That is an example of email analysis which you'll receive three to five times a week. Another example of the email analysis is the Aussie Canada long trade that I posted on trading view. And again if you'd like to follow me on trading view make sure to click the link in the description to do that as well. I explained exactly why I wanted to be in this trade and also I always give my entry stop and at least my first target on each of the trades that I send out. So for $20 your first month you'll be receiving three to five emails like the ones I've just shown you along with my full training course for the EAP. Now this training course will show you my exact rules based strategies that I use in the EAP system. It will not only teach you how to execute those strategies but also how to back test them in the EAP back testing training section on the members page of the website. And as you can see if we scroll down a little further you'll also receive the weekly recap video showing you how the system has performed in previous weeks.
