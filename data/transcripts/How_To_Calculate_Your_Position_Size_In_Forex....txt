Now let's take a look at a position size calculator I like to personally use. This position size calculator is on myfxbook.com. You can literally just type in position size calculator for forex on Google. It'll be one of the first five that pop up or you can just go to the link you can see right under the video. And this makes determining the value of a pip extremely easy without you having to do any math at all. All you have to do is put in the currency pair you're trading, put in your account currency, then you're going to put in your account size. Let's say you have $10,000 account. The next thing you can do is type in what percent of your account you want to risk. Let's go with a 2% risk and then we're going to need your stop loss. Let's say that the amount you're willing to lose on that trade is about 20 pips. Now all you have to do is hit calculate and this will show you the exact amount of units that you need in order to place this specific trade.
