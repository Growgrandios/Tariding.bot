Hey dude, it's Stephen and let's be straight, beginners and struggling traders tend to make a lot of mistakes. Shoot, I make mistakes in my own trading even to this day at times. And I know for a fact, I made many many more when I first started out. But what we're going to talk about today is what I consider the biggest mistake the beginners make when trading live. So if you are currently just starting out on your trading path or if you're still struggling to get those consistent profits, then it's very likely that you're still making this mistake and we need to get it fixed ASAP so that you can avoid the situation where you lose trades, continuously get frustrated and eventually either blow your account or give up on trading all together. So let's talk about what this mistake is and exactly how to solve it directly after the intro and disclaimer. I'll see you guys in just a second. Whoa, that market is moving fast, right? No, I'm just kidding. That's actually a live trade that I had recorded from earlier this morning on a five minute chart sped up 300 times. Now it was only at the end of this trade that I started to realize there was no way that someone who was a beginner or most struggling traders would have been able to make it through the whole trade and end up with profits at the end. And so what I want to do is break down this trade with you here in just a second on market replay mode, talk you through this main mistake, this biggest problem that beginners face when trading live and then we'll dive into the solutions to that problem directly afterwards to help you avoid this big mistake. So if that sounds good, make sure you're subscribed because we come out with content like this each and every week is down below the video to the right hand side. Click the notification bell because I don't want you to miss it. Click that like button. Let's dive into some charts. Okay, so first off, whenever you get into a trade, you need to have what I call a plan of attack and an exit strategy. Your plan of attack is the reason you got involved in the trade. Let's talk about that really quickly. Super simple entry year. What I was looking at is a market that was consolidating. What does consolidating mean? It means that this market found this area as resistance a bunch of times in the past while doing so. It was bouncing off of a level of support back to that support a bunch of times in the past. Therefore, the market is consolidating between these two levels at the time of me placing the trade with that consolidation in mind. What I decided to do was look left, find my most previous or most recent level of that resistance and I took a sell trade based on two things. One, the market pierced that level with a wick. This shows me selling pressure, five selling pressure and then continued pressure after that sell pressure bar, which is exactly what the green bar with the long wick is is a sell pressure bar. After that, I started seeing this red candle push down and I entered somewhere in the middle of that red candle being formed. That was the entry on this trade or the plan of attack as you want to say. The next step anytime you place a trade is to have a level where you know you are wrong. If this market breaks out to the upside and goes above this period of consolidation that I have pointed out and looking left, am I right or wrong about my analysis? If I was expecting the market to go down and it breaks above that period of consolidation, then I'm okay saying it, I was wrong. So that's where my stop loss goes and that's what you always want to have. Did my voice really just crack that bad? Rewind the video real quick. Stop loss is what you'll hear. That was ridiculous. Oh my god. We'll pretend I didn't do that. But anyway, we have a level that we know we're wrong called a stop loss. We want as well, we also want a level in the market where you anticipate the market to go and you're going to take profits off your make money level, whatever you want to call it. Both of these are a part of your exit strategy. So with that plan in mind, let's take a look at this trade. This trade is set up with my plan in mind. But what happens is you'll have this plan at the beginning, right? And you have your risk reward set. You have a two reward for your one risk. That's what everybody always tells beginners to do. That's what we did on this trade. But what happens during the trade is this plan goes. This is the worst drawing I've ever done. Completely out of this window. The plan goes out the window. You didn't know where I was going with that drawing, did you? The plan completely goes out the window when this market starts to move. Here's why. Right now you're all happy. You're a little bit in profit, right? Let's push the market forward one bar. Oh my gosh. You see that? At one point, you were more than halfway to your target. But this is where beginners and struggling traders start to make so many mistakes. At this point, they'll start second guessing themselves. Did I really pick the right trade? Oh my gosh. I didn't see this previous level of resistance that might turn into support right now. And I might get stopped out. Oh my gosh. So they start getting worried the fear that they experience. Comment below if you've ever experienced this type of fear before. You see something like this and you question your initial trade. You question all your initial thoughts about this being consolidation, this being resistance, this candle being selling pressure, whatever your plan of action was at the beginning starts to again go out that window whenever you see something like this happen. Because now the market's being supported by this previous level of structure resistance. And what happens next is the reason most beginners do something called exit their trade early. Oh my gosh. Buying pressure afterwards, this big green candle. I'm pretty much back at break even when I was just let's call this $200 up at the time. I think I was like $300 up here. But let's say you go from $200 a head on a trade back to break even. And this is what the market looks like. We have a previous resistance here. The market looks like it's about to push up. Most beginners will say screw that initial plan I had. I don't want to lose this trade. So what do they end up doing? What would you do in this situation? And what have you done when seeing market structure look like this? Tell me if I'm lying. Have you not before? I know I've done it before, especially at the beginning of my trading career. I did this a lot. Have you not just taking your trade off right here? Yes or no, right? Comment below. Let other traders know as well. So they know they're not long. Here's the biggest problem with this. Initially, we had a two to one risk reward. Let's say trading like this every single time gives you about a 50% chance to win, but you got a two to one reward to risk. So guess what? Over a long period of time, you make money. You see as traders, we don't know what will happen on one trade. I had no clue what this specific trade was going to do. Guess what? If I had a crystal ball and if you had a crystal ball, if anyone had that crystal ball that would tell them exactly what a specific one trade would do, then everyone would be billionaires. I would bet every bit of money I've ever made in my entire life on that one trade. But we don't. So what we have to do is traders has set ourselves up to have an advantage over a long period of time, over a large sample size of trades. And the way we do that is by finding a way of trading that gives us over a 50% chance to win and a higher than one to one risk reward. But in terms of this specific trade, we don't know what's going to happen. So this is what the real problem is whenever you do something like move your stop loss or move your target up, excuse me, you take these profits off early and you go, well, at least I made money. It looks like the market's going to turn around anyway. I'm in the green. I did a good job. You start patting yourself on the back. Oh, I did great. Good job, Steven. You got out in the green. You got out with money. But guess what this does? What if you continue to be? And by the way, statistics show that the average retail trader is about 50% accurate. Well, if you continue to be 50% accurate, and this is what your profits look like, and this is what you're losing what your stop loss looks like, do you think you're going to be a winning trader? This is why so many people bleed their account drives because taking profits early is one of the biggest mistakes I see traders make. We're going to talk about how to solve that in a second. Let's continue looking at the chart though. Right now, instead of a two to one, you're getting a zero point two to one. So the zero point two being your profit. This is not the direction you want your reward to risk to be in. What this means is that for every $100 you risk on average, you're only making $20. And if you are only winning at 50% of the time, this is a recipe for disaster recipe for a blown account completely. And it's exactly how you're going to end up missing out on trades that do something like this. Then eventually push down and hit your target. Our targets were hit right here. So what you end up doing is setting yourself up with a backwards risk to reward ratio whenever you take profits off early. And there are three main causes of this that we're going to discuss. Right now, these are going to be the solution to you having this issue. Again, if you have this issue, let other traders know they're not alone and leave it in the comments below. I know I've done it before is the reason I wanted to make this video. I remember this being one of my biggest issues. I'll never forget there's there've been I'll never forget the 10 top trades that I could have had. I didn't catch because I did this because I took off trades early. And I'm sure you've been in a situation where you look back at charts afterwards and you go, man, if I wasn't attacking those profits early way up here, I could have had that two, three, five, 10 to one risk reward out of this trade. But instead, I broke the rules of my plan. So now let's discuss three ways that you can avoid this situation and get back on the path of accomplishing your trading goals. I'll see in a second. So the first thing we're going to discuss is why this happens. Why do we make mistakes like this? Me included at the beginning of my career. And the reason was because I was emotional. The reason you're making those mistakes is because you're emotional when you're hard earned money is at risk. When you have a chance to make big money, you get emotional. So how do we solve these issues? Well, we have to take emotions completely out of the equation. And the first way that we do that is by having a plan like we discussed in the beginning, you want to have a plan of action. You want to have a place where you know you are wrong that you can cut your losses and you want to have an area where you think the market's probably going to go that you're going to take off your profits. If you don't have these things and you have no plan of action, pre trade before you ever click the button, what will happen? And this is what happens to so many beginners that end up blowing their account is you'll place the trade randomly. Oh, we're at resistance. I'm placing a trade, but you don't have a stop area where you know you're wrong and you don't have an area where you think you're going to take targets off, then what happens is the market starts pushing up and you start trading based on luck and hope because you're just hoping that this market starts pushing back down and the higher it gets, the more emotional you get, the more you want it to push down. And about up here, when your emotions become too much, emotions too much, that's when you finally cut your losses and you've now lost way more than you should have on a trade. Even worse than that, what if the market would have done this? You didn't have an area for your target to be taken off. The market pushing down like this gets all the way down here and then pushes all the way back up and stops you out. If that's the case, you will never want to trade this strategy again. You'll be even more emotional the next time you're in a trade and the next time you're in a trade, you're going to cut your profits very, very soon. It's kind of a domino effect or a snowball effect when you start making these mistakes because it just makes you more and more emotional. So step number one is always have a plan prior to placing the trade and you can't deviate from it. That plan, you need to stick to it. Okay. So that is step number one. Step number two, how do we stick to that plan? Well, step number two is we back test that plan. This needs to be rules based. The trade that I took was rules based, right? The trade I took is we're in consolidation. That is condition number one. We're at either previous resistance or support after knowing we're in consolidation. In this case, we're at previous resistance. My third condition was I see selling pressure from a candlestick pattern. And my entry itself was the next candle that begins, starts as a red candle and starts pushing down. Then I entered the trade. This is what we call our entry. The rest of our trading plan, our strategy comes down to our stops and targets, which also needs to be rules based. For me, that is stops above the consolidation level targets at the previous level of support for this short trade. I'm not going to dive super deep into strategies, but we need it to be rules based so we can take and test it. See if out of the last 100 times this happened, did it produce profit? Did it produce money over that long period of time? Remember earlier in the video, our whole purpose here is not to estimate and exactly know with our crystal ball what one trade will do. No one can do that. No one. But what we can do is measure out a large sample size and trade something that over that large sample size will make money over time. This, for example, exact system that I traded, I've tested through hundreds and hundreds of trades in historic data. Way, way long time ago, I've since then traded this strategy hundreds and hundreds of times. And throughout all of that testing and trading, it wins about 55% of the tax, it's actually a little less. It's like 53.9% of the time. I have it all in a spreadsheet. So it's about 54% accurate and consistently gives close to a two, uh, two reward to one risk. So a two to one reward to risk ratio with these numbers over a large sample size or over a long period of time, I consistently make money using this system. That's what you need to have. And the reason you need all these rules in place is so you can test it and make sure it's made money in the past. That's how you get the confidence to not exit the trade right here. When the market pushes up, like we talked about earlier, you don't want to be exiting your trade because you're getting all emotional. The way you take emotions out is by statistics and logic. And you find those out with a rules based strategy that you have tested through historic data and saw that it performs well over large sample sizes and produces a profit over those large sample sizes. The third way that we reduce emotions is by reducing risk. If you are a beginner right now or someone who's struggling in your trading, there is a very high chance that you are risking too much, especially if you feel emotional when you're placing trades. If you feel emotional when you're placing trades, then it's because of one of these reasons and you admit it to yourself right now. And if it helps, put it in the comment section below. If you are currently struggling or brand new in trading and you're not making money, do you have a plan every time you place a trade? Have you back tested that plan to prove that it's made money at least out of the last hundred times it's happened? Or if you don't like back testing, forward tested, demo trade it for six months, no rush, demo trade for six months using your plan that you've made to see if that produces profit over those six months. And number three, are you risking too much? If you lose a trade, does it make you really, really emotional because you lost that trade? So step number three in this process of solving one of the biggest mistakes that struggling traders and beginner traders make is to make sure you are not risking too much per trade. And there's no real answer to that other than your own risk tolerance. For me, it's between one and two percent of my total account balance per trade. That's what I like to risk and that's what keeps me from getting hyper emotional because at this point, if I lose the trade and lose two percent of my account balance, I'm okay with that. That doesn't bother me at all. So I'm now okay losing the trade. I have a plan that I know has made money in the past. It takes all the emotions away and allows me to get into and stay in trades that can produce a really, really nice profit.
