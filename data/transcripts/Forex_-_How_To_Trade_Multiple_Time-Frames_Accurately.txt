Hey traders, I hope you're all having a fantastic start to your weekend. Today's video is going to be a breakdown of the top five major pairs. I'm going to talk about what I'm looking at in terms of what's going to happen next week on the top five major pairs and pretty much how I break a chart down technically in order to make those predictions. I'm also going to throw a few extra nuggets in this video to make sure to stick around to the end if you're not subscribed here.

Follow us on the socials and I'll see you guys directly after the intro and disclaimer. All right traders welcome back so we're going to start our analysis off here on the euro dollar as we normally do and I'm actually going to take this down to a four hour chart on this specific currency pair. The reason we're looking at the four hour chart is because we actually had a trade on this pair last week in the AAP training program and this trade was based on a couple of things that we use in order to break down charts using technical analysis every single week and I'm going to talk about those right now. So for one why was I interested in a trading opportunity from this level around 1.127 for here on the euro dollar that's what we're going to break down right now. In order to do that we're going to jump out to the daily chart. So here we are on a higher time frame. If you've seen a few of our videos where we break down charts like this you'll know that the first two things I always look at are on a daily chart or a weekly chart some kind of high time frame. Specifically in this case the daily chart I take a look at the daily chart and I ask myself two very important questions. The first one being what trend is this market in on that high time frame and in this case in the case of the euro dollar that was a downtrend. I also ask myself where are major levels of structure that I should be paying attention to for trading opportunities in that direction. If it's a downtrend in the shorting direction in the downward direction. So in this case we had a downtrend on the euro dollar. I'm going to break that down for you now. We are on the daily chart. Let me take the moving average off and just breaking it down looking at price action. The reason that last week in last week's video or maybe the week before we talked about this level. We didn't talk about this level. Excuse me. We talked about this market being in a downtrend is because of this. We have a high right here. This high down to low. Then created a lower high followed by a new lower low in this case right here after this little one two three move is what I call this after this one two three move. I know that I am looking for this market to either break this lower high in order to give me a possible reversal or come down and break this lower low in order to give me train continuation at the moment of our video a couple of weeks ago. The market was up here. Yes, we had had a surge up right. But the market had not closed above this lower high because of that. I said that what I expected out of this market was for it to push downward. Now I will play a little short clip right now of that analysis just to show you guys exactly what I was looking at and I'll be right back afterwards. Trades now if we get below that level, I have another level of possible support right here at one point one two even which is another level I'll look for possible bounces from something like this could definitely happen. And then I'll look for another counter train bounce there along with the fact that it's okay. So as you can see that prediction worked out quite well. We did push down. We actually came down to our next support level that we pointed out and had a pretty nice push up from that level. Now after that fact what I was waiting on and the reason we had a trade from this level around one point one two seven in the AP training program is as you can see this level right here in our red zone is an area that's been tested once twice three times four times as support in the past. So with that being the case, I thought that it was a great level to start looking for possible shorting opportunity considering that the overall trend here on the euro dollar on the daily chart is down considering that this is a major level of structure and considering that on a lower time frame if we drop to the four hour we had this nice double top formation looking at push up one top double top thinking we could possibly see this market continue down at least retesting one point one one nine possibly even going into train continuation based on that daily chart analysis. So hopefully that helps you understand how that daily chart technical analysis plays along with whatever strategy whatever system you're using on a lower time frame. So for me the interesting that I was using on a lower time frame was a specific kind of double top that we teach in the AP training program but I had to add the analysis beforehand in order for this to be a trading opportunity for me and as you can see on the screen this trading opportunity did not work in my favor unfortunately ended up pushing up it did push down to get about halfway to our targets a little more than halfway but then pushed up instead off to self or break even for those of you who are new to trading what's important to understand is that every trade won't win and what's also important to understand is that although this trade lost if I had the opportunity to enter this same exact trade over and over let's say I get a double top at a major level of structure wild the markets in a downtrend a specific double top and I have my stop loss and target rules set if my strategy is met if all my rules are met I place the trade I would do this 100 more times and the way we have an advantage in the forex market and in any financial market if you're trading based on technical analysis is that you have a statistical advantage using that I know there's somewhere around based on the exact rules I use a 55 to 65 percent chance that I win I also trade multiple targets which gives me a little better than a one-to-one risk reward with those odds I will place this trade over and over 100 times that's something very important to remember as you're learning to trade and learning to do this so let's go ahead now and move on to our second currency pair that we're going to take a look at which is the pound dollar all right and we are on the four-hour chart let's zoom back out to the daily chart here we are now on the daily and let's take a look at this this currency pair ask ourselves the same exact questions that I just talked about currently what trend is the pound dollar in let's do that same exact analysis right we have a starting point right here we're going to call this a low we have a push up a push down a push up to about here so this is now our higher high considering that this becomes our higher low we then break into what new higher highs have we broken and at this exact point our higher low no we have not we have not broken our higher our higher low and have we made a one two three move what I mean by that is have we made a one two three move breaking a level of structure this would be the level of structure we were looking to break on that one two three move no so we're not looking for possible reversals and what does that tell us if we're making higher lows and higher highs it's telling us that we are in an uptrend here on the pound dollar now that that analysis is out of the way okay my first step is done we're in an uptrend next up what did I say we're looking for well after looking and seeing that we're in an uptrend we're going to look for major levels of structure we're going to find those levels as a level in the market that's been tested at least three times and very easily I can put this horizontal line on the screen and you can see that this level has been tested more than three times now one little hit that I will give you is that these levels work great I use them in my trading every single day but the only part of this specific chart that scares me is the fact that we are consistently making lower highs we're making lower highs we have the same exact support level that oftentimes insinuates that we will see a breakdown of that level so I'm not looking for long opportunities here on the pound dollar going into next week and I'm not looking for shorting opportunities until we get this move if we get a move that breaks below 1.3 and we get a close below that level on a daily chart my next trading opportunity for me is going to be this zone right here we're going to see if we can get a pullback into that zone and same thing drop down to a lower time frame use my actual strategy my actual system on that lower time frame to look for a trading opportunity to the short side that's what I have right now for the pound dollar and of course if this market does continue up we also have a level of resistance around 1.3305 and if we get up to that level next week that's a level I'll look for possible shorting opportunities from so those are my two trade ideas my two trading opportunity zones I have on the pound dollar hopefully that gives you an idea of what I'm looking for on that pair and how I'm going to use this daily chart technical analysis in order to actually make trades on lower time frames let's go to the dollar yin now okay the OTC zone that we pointed out last week was in this area between 11217 and 11175 on the dollar yin I'll show you an example of the pro trader report we sent out to everyone involved in that program links in the description if you want to learn more and in that program we told traders that's a little bit too big we told traders that this would be an area to look for shorting opportunities from or at least I would be looking for shorting opportunities in that area we also just saw that on the video clip as you can see this market reacted really well to that level now let's throw in the educational side of this why was it a level we were looking at well if you're looking at this and you ask yourself the same two questions we've been asking for every currency pair what trend is this in well at that moment we had kind of started reversing into an uptrend right we have this low to high new higher low new higher high new higher low new higher high yes we were in somewhat of an uptrend but after this big impulsive move I was considering that this market definitely after this big impulsive move and then having a pretty impulsive move back up we needed to see a correction and because of that I knew that I was going to be looking where at a major level of structure for that correction a major zone this major zone is defined as what we just did that in the last currency pair we talked about that on the pound dollar what did we define a major level of structure is a level that's been tested once resistance twice support three times support a level that's been tested three times or more is what it's a major level of structure so at a major level of structure while the trend is questionable we have this big move down we then have this it did we're really in a period of consolidation so the trend is questionable we're at a major level of structure I expect there to be a correction and then obviously as you can see on the chart the correction did happen now moving forward what are we looking at well we do still have this level of structure that we're currently in on the dollar yen but at this point the market's already reacted from it so what I'm expecting is that we end up breaking above it now as we just talked about on the pound dollar what do you think I'm going to look for once we break up above this level if we break above 11217 we have a candle close above that level my next trading opportunity is going to be a pullback directly into the same exact zone to look for possible long opportunities to the upside out of this dollar yen market that's exactly what I'm going to be looking for moving forward into this coming week and also guys there's a level right here that I'm going to be paying attention to as well as you can see this level tested multiple times as resistance at around 114 even is where I'll look for possible shorting opportunity so something we definitely can see is this push up the pullback into that zone another impulsive move up a possible shorting opportunity from there and then this market continue upwards or even reversing go down but what I know for sure is what I just said I'm looking for a trade in the zone of 11217 between that and 1117 5 a long opportunity if we bust above this or go above this level now and looking for shorting opportunities around 114 if we can get up to that level next week on the dollar yen now we'll move on to our next pair which is the Aussie dollar here on the Aussie dollar we actually finally are making it back to a level of structure and this right here guys this was just a mess right this is just complete consolidation for days and through here and there was really no way to make a good trade out of that consolidation but what we did have and I'll play a clip for this as well is we had a estimation that this level between 0.703 and 0.700 would provide a great opportunity for long trades as you can see that absolutely happened now is this market pushing up and as you can see in the clip we we estimated that this would be a great long opportunities zone and now we have that market pushing up into another zone we were paying attention to why are we paying attention to this zone one two three four times we've tested this level and reacted from it so if we get back into this zone it's definitely a level this week or this coming week excuse me that I'll be paying attention to four shorting opportunities on the Aussie dollar that's what I'm looking at on this currency pair and moving on to our last pair of the day we're going to be now taking a look at the dollar swiss I hope my battery doesn't die on this camera here we are on the dollar Swiss what are we looking at on this currency pair and I also estimated that if we got back up to 0.999 that we would see some type of push down some type of shorter opportunity that analysis didn't play off quite as well as the rest of the currency pairs have but what are we looking at coming up in the future okay let's focus on that for now well what we have in the future is right around the 1.01 level a nice level of resistance that this market could possibly use to push the market down and that's what we're going to be looking at for the remainder of the week now if we do get a pullback down into 1.0 then that'll be a good opportunity to look for long trades for me based on my trading plan and that's something I'll also be taking a look at for is long trades from and possible short trades from 1.01 that's a breakdown of the analysis that I use every day before placing trades hopefully it's been helpful for you if it has make sure to smash that like button make sure you're subscribed here to be alerted
