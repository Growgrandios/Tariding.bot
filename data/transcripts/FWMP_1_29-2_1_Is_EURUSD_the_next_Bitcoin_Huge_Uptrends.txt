The euro dollar has rallied almost 1000 pips since the lows back in November. We've seen this market create new higher highs and higher lows since that date putting us into a massive uptrend. The question is is this uptrend going to continue? If so, how can we hop on that trend or is this 1.2501 level going to be enough resistance to get some relief here out of this euro dollar? That's one of the main topics we'll be discussing in today's video. Hey guys, welcome to weekly market predictions. This is a video we come out with each and every Monday discussing the top five major pairs, the major levels of support and resistance that we're looking at for trading opportunities. We will not only be discussing those trading opportunities but also the trends that each of these markets are in in order to give us a directional bias for the rest of the week. So that sounds interesting too and you want to be alerted every Monday when we come out with these videos make sure you go ahead and click that subscribe button. While the intro and disclaimer roll click that like button for me to help support the channel and I will see you guys on the other side to get this video started. So in last week's weekly market predictions we talked about this market possibly giving us a trend continuation play above 1.2295. That's exactly what we ended up getting. The market pushed down this brief retracement followed by a break above that major level of resistance and in last week's video we talked about getting some trend continuation out of this market up to our next level of resistance at 1.2501 and this being the level we were looking for shorting opportunities on a smaller time frame out of. And last week we also talked about this I know these moves right in here don't look like much but each of these moves has been over a 100 pip drop out of this market and on a smaller timeframe taking advantage of a 100 pip counter trend trade can be really beneficial but there's also a place to take a look at trend continuation plays while this market is in this massive uptrend as well. And we also talked a little bit about that last week so what we're going to do is take a look at a clip from last week's video first and then we'll come back here to the euro dollar to talk about what we're expecting next out of this pair. So let's go ahead and head to that clip and I'll be right back on the euro dollar. Now if the market breaks above our 1.2295 level I'll be looking for trend continuation on smaller time frames all the way up to 1.250. At that levels the next place I'll be looking for counter trend opportunities. So as you can see what we're doing is actually preparing for what the market does because we don't control the market. So traders as you just saw we were expecting some trend continuation above that 1.229 level the market pushed above that level and we did get trend continuation all the way up to 1.2501 which was the level of resistance we were talking about and we got some counter trend movement from that level. So these levels of structure proved to be extremely important and proved to move the market around. Now is this level of resistance going to be enough to provide a massive amount of relief here in this euro dollar uptrend? Well the truth of the matter is that none of us have any way of knowing the answer to that question. So if someone was to come to be and ask me do you think 1.250 is going to be major resistance and that this market is going to fall from this level and start a new downtrend? My answer would have to be I don't know. If they said do you think this market is going to continue in its upward direction based on what you see on the chart? Well of course according to our trend analysis the answer to that question is yes but do we really know with 100% certainty that's going to happen? Of course not because the market itself is a factor that we as traders cannot control. So a huge part of being a professional trader in a way you need to start looking at your trading if you plan to become professional and treat this like a business and as a career is that we can only control one factor in the market and that is what we do not what the market does. None of us control which direction this market is going to go but what we can control is what we do based on what we see on the chart. So what I can tell you although I can't say whether or not this level will act as major resistance and push the market down a dramatic amount. I can tell you that if we get a pullback from that level I will be looking right here at 1.2295 because this is a factor that I can control and if the market gets to that 1.2295 level and this is all I'm creating here I will be looking for long trading opportunities and the reason for that is based on our trend and major levels of structure analysis and the actual entry reason and the strategy that we will use if we get down into this level is the same strategies we discussed in the EAP training program. So that's what we're going to be waiting on this week here out of the euro dollar at first is just to see if we can get to move it down a little bit further into the zone and see if we can catch some kind of long trading opportunity based on our trading plan. If you want to learn a little more about the strategies we use and the entry reasons then you can find that information in the EAP training program which is linked in the description below. And guys I just want to bring this point home a little more about the fact that we can't control the market. I get questions every day from traders and some of those questions sound a little something like this. Stephen what is the market going to do right here? And there is no way for anyone to know the answer to that question a trader may ask me what is the market going to do when it gets to 1.2501 what's the euro dollar going to do? I have no way to answer that question. No one knows what the market's going to do. My entire process consists of predictive analysis. What I'm doing is making predictions on where the market may go and deciding when the market gets there how I'm going to place a trade based on my trading plan. There's no one that knows what the market's going to do when it gets to certain levels. There's no one that knows whether the euro dollar will continue higher or go lower. We can give ourselves a statistical advantage though by creating a trading plan based around conditions and entry reasons that we've tested in historical data. So I hope that was helpful. Maybe that was something you were struggling with in your trading. But anyway let's go ahead and continue our analysis here on the euro dollar. As I said the first thing we're looking for is a pull back into this 1.2295 area. The market happens to go a little bit lower than that. We can also look right in here at this previous support level around 1.22 even for possible long opportunities. This will be the last place. We'll look for trend continuation opportunities because if we break below the support level here we'll be reversing trend. We won't quite be in an actual downtrend yet but this will be our first signal of a possible reversal. If that happens we could see this market continue all the way down to 1.2063 and at that level will be the next place we look for long opportunities. Now if we start to head higher here without even making it to 1.2295 I will not be looking for a shorting opportunity back at 1.2501. This is just way too strong of a market to be looking for a shorting opportunity once again from that level. Instead what we have to do is go ahead and zoom the chart out and find our next level of resistance here on the euro dollar. We're gonna have to go left a good ways all the way back into 2014 to find this resistance and I will zoom the chart in a little bit here. Do you guys see any spots we could look for possible resistance? Based on the way we spot major resistance here at the trading channel. Well I know I see a spot here that's been tested multiple times as resistance and support and also a spot right in here. Here we have support support turned into resistance. Here we have support that turned into resistance again. So these are the next two levels up we'll be looking at for resistance. What we'll do is go ahead and scroll back over and talk through our other possible scenarios. So another possible scenario is that this market continues higher without making that pullback. If we break above 1.2501 the next place I'll be looking for shorting opportunities is right around 1.26 even. That'll be the next place for counter trend opportunities where we'll be looking just as here and here for around 100 pip move back down in the bearish direction and setting ourselves up with some pretty conservative targets because that is going to be a counter trend trade if this market continues up. And if we break above that level the next level we'll be taking a look at is 1.2878 for counter trend opportunities here on the euro dollar. So that's going to do it for the euro dollar. We'll go ahead and move on to our next pair now. What's going to be the pound dollar? So the GBP USD is another one of those pairs has been on a pretty massive up trend actually since we broke out of this period of consolidation right back here. We had that breakout the higher high higher low back up to the higher high down to the higher low and then this massive move up we had starting a couple of weeks ago. Now you can probably guess what I'm waiting on at this point in the market as you can see our yellow box here is pointing out the level of major structure that we're looking at for our trend continuation trade. So what does that mean? That means this market just created a new higher high and this is our likely scenario where the market could turn around. Let's go ahead and take that to a smaller timeframe drop down to the four hour chart. So we're still expecting this market to touch the 1.4409 level. We're seeing this as a push up and this as a pullback this market is going to be in an uptrend at least on this chart we're now in the four hour time frame. We'll be staying in an uptrend until we break below this level here. So for those of you who are in the EAP you know exactly what I'm looking for in this box. And that's what we'll continue to look for as long as this market consolidates in this area. Also we're going to see what happens here because we've already had this really nice candle week to the downside right here at this level. So we'll see if this market can pull this candle back up before the close of the candle in the next 30 minutes or so and then we'll start looking for some type of entry reason right around in this level here on the pound dollar. Now we're not going to place a trade unless we get some type of entries and that's a huge thing that you have to understand. We're not just randomly placing trades around these levels. We have a full trading plan that we use in order to place these trades around these major levels of structure we find out on the higher time frames. So for the pound dollar that is our very first scenario we're looking for exactly where the market is right now we're waiting on some type of entry reason to go long because of the trend we see out on a higher time frame we're obviously in an uptrend and because the fact that we've now pulled back into a major level of structure that's been tested as resistance and support and respected as resistance and support back in the past. So what if this level does not hold again that's the first thing we're looking for but if this level does not hold to say we don't get an entry reason the next place we'll be looking for long opportunities is around 1.3853. Now as for resistance we do get a long opportunity from this level and the market pushes up the place we'll be looking at four second targets along with looking at this level for counter-trained opportunities is 1.4409 that's our first level of resistance that we'll be looking at again for counter-trained opportunities and for second targets if we get a trade from that level. Let's go ahead and zoom the chart out because we are now going to have to find another level of resistance here for the pound dollar and I already have one spotted I'll give you guys a second to see if you can point it out. Our new level of resistance is going to be coming in right in there and the reason for that guys is because this is a level that's been tested as support back here resistance and we can call it resistance in through here as well multiple times. So considering that this 1.46 level has acted as resistance and support in the past multiple times we could also possibly see that level act as resistance yet again. So for that scenario what we'd be looking for is a move up possibly a break above our 1.4409 level and then another move up before we could look for some counter-trained opportunities around 1.46 and that's what we're looking at here on the pound dollar as for the immediate future plus what we're looking for a little more long term. Let's go ahead and move on to our next pair now which is going to be the dollar yen and first we're going to take a look at last week's video where we talked about some trend continuation on the dollar yen and then we'll get started with the analysis and what we can expect next out of this pair. So we're still floating around the 110.5 area now here we can really expect some trend continuation do I expect another rally off of this level not necessarily I'm actually based on what we see on smaller time frames and based on what we see here on the daily chart expecting this to be a move down so I'm not really looking for any buying opportunities around the 110.5 area more so looking for trend continuation opportunities when we get below that area and maybe looking at it becoming resistance would be really the first choice for this week is if we could get a push below 110.5 and a pullback into that area then that's an area I'll be looking at for shorting opportunities and trend continuation here on the dollar yen and look for trend continuation all the way down to 108.97 which is our next level of major support here on the dollar yen now so here on the dollar yen we never did get that pullback back into 110.5 that we were looking for instead the market just continued in trend all the way down to the 108.97 level we were discussing last week at this level as you can see we had a little bit of support out of the market with these two candle wicks here pushing the market back up and then we have this big bearish candle pushing the market down now currently we're just consolidating around this level so what we want to see is either another bearish close somewhere down below this previous low and if that's the case then we'll expect trend continuation down to 107.52 which will be our next level of possible counter trend support or we want to see this market starting to close back above the 108.97 level if that's the case then we can start looking for some counter trend opportunities at this level maybe to push the market back up to the 110.5 area if we do get a candle close that's back below this previous low that was created then what we'll do is wait for either trend continuation plays on lower time frames all the way down to that 107.5 level or we'll be waiting on a pullback up into 108.97 either one of those scenarios is possible this week and that's what we'll be looking for initially and what can we look for a little more long term if this market does rally out of this level finds a little bit of resistance at 110.5 if we get a possible second move up we'll be looking at resistance around 111.79 here on the dollar yen now as for another level of support we'll actually have to zoom the chart out a pretty good bit to find this next level of support but the level of support we're going to be paying attention to below 107.52 is right in that area around 105.51 so a long ways to go here on the dollar yen if we break below that 107.52 area and guys the reason we're paying attention to this area is because it acts as support here and as resistance right here now this can be looked at as a zone we could say that from this resistance level down this entire zone here could be our support zone if that was the case then we'll be looking somewhere between 106 and 105.5 for our next zone of support here on the dollar yen if again we get that break below 107.52 so that's our analysis here on the dollar yen that's some of the things we're expecting in the very recent future along with some things that we can look for a little bit more long term so let's go ahead and move on to our next pair now which is going to be the Aussie dollar and again we're going to go ahead and take a look at a clip from last week's video talking about some train continuation on this pair which is exactly what we got and then we'll come back to the Aussie dollar here and talk about what we're expecting next on this pair so let's go ahead and take a look at that clip train continuation to the upside and if the market hits higher I will more than likely be stopped out of the trade I'm in currently unless we get down there and hit the first targets beforehand and the next level resistance I'll be paying attention to is 0.8117 right here at this most previous high which is also active support and resistance multiple times looking left so so guys as you can see here on the Aussie dollar chart we ended up getting exactly what we were expecting we got some train continuation out of this pair right above 0.8023 and just in case you didn't notice on the weekly market predictions clip I just showed you guys these levels had not been tested as resistance or support yet so these were predictions made before price action made this move but price action makes move higher we expected train continuation up to 0.8117 and that's exactly what we got and to make this a little more clear to see what I'm going to do is actually take the chart down to a four-hour time frame so let's go ahead and do that so here's our first move and last week during that weekly market prediction video the market was about right in there so as I said the 0.8023 level had not been tested as support and the 0.8117 level had not been tested as resistance those were just predictions we were making based on major levels of structure which hopefully by the end of this video and hopefully you've seen a few of these weekly market prediction videos if not go back and check a few of them out you will notice that these levels of structure that we point out using a specific method and specific rules to point them out can really be a beneficial thing to add to a trading plan so let's go ahead and scoot the chart over and as you can see we get that push above our major level of resistance at 0.8023 that we were expecting trend continuation after the push above so we push above continue and trend all the way up to what our previous level of resistance we were talking about in last week's video 0.8117 we get over a 100 pip drop all the way down to that same 0.8023 level previous structure resistance does what normally becomes support so once we got down to that level then what happened another push up we got another over 100 pip push up from this level that it didn't become support as you know these major levels of structure or structure that can be support or resistance once we got that push up back to 0.8117 the market put in a nice candle wake to the top side and since then we've seen a little bit of a drop out of this market from this level now let's go ahead and talk a little bit about what we're expecting next here out of the aussie dollar well currently we are in a period of consolidation in between these two areas we're in a period of consolidation between 0.8117 and 0.8023 because of that if the market gets down to 0.8023 of course we'll be looking for some kind of long opportunity we'll be looking at this level as support in this period of consolidation if we get a push back up to 0.8117 that's where we'll be looking for possible short opportunities that's pretty simple now if the market breaks below the 0.8023 level the next place we'll be looking for support is around 0.7893 now as for the next level of resistance let's go ahead and zoom back out to a daily chart and we'll have to scroll back to try to find this next level of resistance which happens to be right in there as you can see this level is a place where the market used as resistance resistance resistance and resistance right in there because of that we're looking at that as our next possible place for counter-trend opportunities here on the Aussie dollar so if this market continues in the uptrend we're seeing right now and breaks above 0.8117 that the next place we'll be looking for a counter-trend opportunity is 0.8215 and that's what we're looking at here on the Aussie dollar let's go ahead and move on to our final pair of the video which is going to be the dollar swiss so here we are on the dollar swiss and we're actually floating around a major level of structure right now around those 0.9385 level right in here is a place we can expect the market to find possible resistance in trend continuation now is that exactly what i'm looking for well no if i get an entry reason here will i take the trade yes of course but that's not what i'm necessarily expecting to happen because of this huge move we've had down on the dollar here lately i actually expect a bit more relief out of this pair and i'm looking more so right up here at the 0.9446 level for possible resistance now my trading plan says that i can take a trade from the 0.9385 level so of course if some kind of really good injuries and happens on a smaller time frame at this level then i will be taking a trade but again in my opinion the more likely scenario is a bit more of a rally out of this market before we see that next continuation in the current down trend when we see that continuation what are our counter trend levels well the first level we can look at is where this spike came into you see this candle wick here that spiked down to the 0.92 9.5 level right around the 0.93 even level that's the first place we can look for counter trend long opportunities here on the dollar swiss if we get a push down the second place if we break below that is 0.9163 for another possible level for counter trend trades and that's what we're looking at on the top five major pairs and that's what we're looking at here on the dollar swiss those are the trends we see in the market the major levels of structure we're placing trades around and i look at what we expect to happen on these top five major pairs throughout the rest of this week again if you guys would like to learn a little more about the way we trade here at
