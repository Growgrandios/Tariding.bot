Hey everyone, Steven here from the Trading Channel. In this week's video, I want to be sharing with you how my first week of January has been in Forex Trading. I try to do a review video like this every week showing you the wins and losses that have happened to me throughout the week and also showing you the strategies that I used in order to accrue those wins and losses. So far in the first week of January, I've been able to produce around 200 pips and if you stick around for the whole video, I will explain to you exactly how I produced those 200 pips. I will also be sharing with you an equity curve of how my trading has been since I started this YouTube channel and as well as and I will be sharing a couple of ideas that I plan on taking advantage of in the next week if the opportunities occur. So I will let the intro and disclaimer roll and I will be back soon to share with you how January has treated me so far. Alright, so today we will start out on the Euro Dollar and I will be explaining to you a couple of the trades that we took on the Euro Dollar. But before we do that, I just wanted to say that I am coming out with a video explaining how I trade the garlic pattern next week. So if that is something you are interested in or if you are interested in getting email alerts whenever I come out with more videos that review my strategies for the past week like this one then make sure you subscribe to this channel and click that like button for me. It really helps me out and I would really appreciate it. Alright, so we will scroll down to the charts here and I will show you how we traded the Euro Dollar this week. First off I will show you the loss that we had here on the Euro Dollar and that came in way of a 786 trade. The 786 trade is a trade that I use in my strategies in order to profit from trend continuation. And the way I do that is from this swing high here when the market breaks into new lows and breaks and closes below a previous support level, I take my Fibonacci retracement from the swing high down to the new swing low that is created and I sell the 786. In anticipation for the market to come back down and at least test these structure levels. As you can see here we came up into the 786, made it to the 886 retracement right here, almost testing this previous structure level and retraced about 38, 40% maybe before starting to rally and eventually coming up to retest this structure level. And if you haven't seen my tutorial on the 786 strategy I will post a link in the bottom left. It is a free tutorial I have on YouTube explaining exactly how I use this strategy. The next step on the euro dollar, if I delete this, we actually had a butterfly pattern here. And I don't normally trade the butterfly pattern but with this one it came in close to a structure level so that gave me a good place to put stops and with that being the case I decided to take it almost as a structure trade so it was almost just an excuse to get involved in a structure trade at this level. So as you can see we get above a 786 retracement from this swing high to this swing low. Take our Fibonacci extension from A back up to X then back down to A. We see we get a 1618 extension coming in right here around the previous structure level. And if we take our extension tool here from C up to B and back down in you see that we have a 2.618 in confluence with the 1.618 right in this area close to a previous structure level. And I will draw this pattern in for you so it is a little easier to see coming down up above a 786 coming down past 382 then back up into this little zone right here. I decided to take a short trade right here with targets at a normal place for targets for a butterfly pattern which would be a 382 retracement from there up to the structure level and we were able to bank in around 68 pips on this trade. As you can see stops went above this previous structure level here in yellow and targets were down at the 382. Next up we will take a look at the dollar yen and on the dollar yen we had a cipher pattern this week. I will zoom my chart in to make it a little easier for you to see. And I will give you a second to look at it here. And also I forgot to mention I am going to be doing a tutorial on the butterfly pattern and how I trade it within the next week so if that is something you are interested in being alerted about through email then make sure to subscribe to the channel for email alerts on all of my future videos. And the cipher pattern comes in from x to a, a to b, b to c and cd completion right there. Now something else that we noticed while we were looking here at this market is that we also put in, if we take a look at this leg here, this entire move as our impulse leg, we also put in a garlic pattern near the same level. So the garlic pattern had a d point that was almost at the same level as the d point of our cipher, giving us even more confirmation in this trade. So this was our short zone right here. The zone that we were interested in selling in was right there. So we had a push up to this area which triggered my limit orders, my limit orders for advanced patterns, just go right at the d level. I don't use a potential reversal zone like a lot of people do. So I was triggered right here on this candle wick. And as you can see, we came up to retest this structure level here, but did not go very far above it. So stops were not triggered and we easily rolled over to hit targets on this trade that we were involved in because of two advanced pattern setups. Next we'll scroll down to the dollar Swiss. From the dollar Swiss, we had a cipher pattern coming in from here, x to a, a to b, b to c, and cd completion right in there. I'll bring on some fibs to see how close I am. Not very close. Well, as you can see, this cipher pattern did come down and retest this structure right here. Put us through a little bit of pain, but then ultimately turned around before hitting our stops and came up to hit profit targets on this trade. And also what I'm looking at going into next week for the dollar Swiss is see if you can spot it. I'll give you a hint. This is the impulse leg. So if we take a look at that being our impulse leg, then we will have another garlic pattern coming in to next week. Now this one has a long way to go, and I'm not saying that it will complete, but that's a big part of trading successfully is being very far ahead of the market because none of us can predict exactly what the market's going to do. All we can do is have a plan for if the market comes up into this level. I know exactly what I'm going to do. If the market breaks below this level, breaks and closes below this level here, then I know exactly what I'm going to do because I have a strategy called the 786 strategy. I'll take a Fibonacci retracement from here to wherever this market terminates. And I'll place an order at the 786 with stops above here and targets back down a previous structure. So I already know what I'm going to do here on the dollar Swiss, whether this market breaks below and closes below this structure here or comes back up to try to retest and consolidates in this area, making it to our 127 extension. I know what I'm going to do either way. And that's what I'm talking about when I say that's a big part of being a successful trader is knowing what you're going to do way in advance of the market actually doing it. Moving on to the pound dollar. On the pound dollar this week, we had a 786 trade. If you've seen my video tutorial on this strategy, you can probably already tell where this is at. But if not, I'll go ahead and draw it in for you. Here's our most previous swing high. Here's a break below, close below. So we take our Fibonacci retracement from our most previous swing high down to our swing low. We enter the market at the 786 looking for a retest of structured lows or the lows of the bodies here. And we have stops just above the previous structure high. That's the way the setup looked. That was another trade we were involved in this week. We'll move on now to the dollar cad. The dollar cad produced a bat pattern and a structured trade force this week. I'll show you the structure trade first. If we take a look at the dollar cad, you can see that we've just been on a very, very bullish trend for a long time now. Seeing this, I started to look for a reason to get long this pair. And what I saw when I came into the market was this nice structure level right here that seems to be holding up pretty well. We had a break above, close above here, followed by a test of this structure level and then a rejection up here followed by this retest. And this retest here is where I decided to get long. Once we tested this level with this candle wick here, I actually bought the market at the open of the very next candle with stops under previous structure and targets the previous high of the body of these candles. So that gave me a really nice risk to reward. And also, I had a good reason for entry with this double bottom coming in right here at previous structure. Once we saw that there was a bat pattern setting up right here, if I zoom in a little further, you can see this much better. As you can see, we came down X to A came up to a 50% retracement here, came down to at least a 382, did not break below A, and we came up to our 886 before rolling over in these two candles and hitting our profit targets. If you haven't seen my tutorial on the bat pattern, I'll post a link in the bottom left of your screen so you can click that and head on over to the trading channel and check out the free tutorial on how I trade the bat pattern to see how I take advantage of consolidation in the markets. Next up is the Aussie CAD. Right on the Aussie CAD, as you can see, I still have my profit targets and stop losses in right here. It was just a simple 786 strategy. I'll delete all this so I can explain it to you a little better. But what we had was a swing high here, swing low here. The market came down, broke below and closed below this swing low. I took a Fibonacci retracement from this swing high down to the swing low and I sold the 786 retracement right there in anticipation of trend continuation to the downside. So what I was looking for was a retest of these previous lows with stops right above structure highs. As you can see, it sets you up with a really good risk to reward and you are with the underlying trend when placing trades like this. As you can see, heavily bearish market. So with this retracement, give you a really good risk to reward setup and as I said before, you are with the underlying trend. If you haven't seen my tutorial on the 786 strategy that I use in the markets every day, then I will post a link in the bottom left of your screen for you to go over there and take a look at that at the trading channel. Next up is the Euro Aussie. We actually had two losses on the Euro Aussie this week, both coming from a 786 trades. The first 786 trade we took was right here on the Euro Aussie. As you can see, we had a break above, close above here. So I took my Fibonacci retracement from this swing low. Hope to swing high. And I was looking for the 786 here and the market just blew right through it and came down and actually broke below and closed below our previous support level here. As you can see, putting in a lower, lower, lower close of this level. So at that point, I just decided to reverse my thinking and go bearish on this pair and try 786 strategy to the downside because of this break below, close below, which is in my rules for my trading plan. So this is what I had to do. But as you can see again, broke below, close below, but then rallied back up above the 786 and we're now on to new equity highs. So that was my two losses on the Euro Aussie. The pound swiss did not produce any trades this week. And the Euro pound, the last pair we'll look at today, produced a bat pattern and a cipher pattern. The cipher pattern came in from back here. This being our X leg. X up to A right in here gave us a 382 retracement. So next we're looking for a 127 extension from X to A back down in. This is a 127 extension. So now we have a pattern that looks something like this. And as you can see, it came down to retest this previous structure level here and then shot up to easily hit targets. But before that, we actually had a bat pattern on this pair coming in X to A, A to B, B to C and CD completion right up there. Zoom this in a little bit, make it easier for you to see. And as you can tell, we came down to hit R382 targets pretty easily well before being stopped out of this trade. And if you don't know how to trade the bat pattern yet, then I'll post a link in the bottom left of your screen to a tutorial that I did a while back on how I trade the bat pattern in the forex markets every day. Alright everybody, so that's it for the charts today. Now I'm going to go over to our equity curve. The equity curve that I have is a separate account that I use just for this YouTube channel. And on this account, I only trade the one hour time frame. And also, I only use strategies that I either teach or plan to teach here on my YouTube channel. So if you're a beginner or if you're not so new but still having trouble being profitable as a forex trader, then head on over to my channel and check out some of the free tutorials I have. And also go ahead and subscribe to get email alerts every time I come out with a new video. Now I'll head on over to our spreadsheet and plug these numbers in from this week. This week on the euro dollar, we started off with a loss. And that loss was a loss of 48 pips. So if I just plug in minus 48. And I want you guys to look at the equity curve while I do this just so you can see that it's never going to be a straight up climb on your equity curve. You're always going to have to deal with losses no matter what strategy you trade. And next we had a butterfly pattern on the euro dollar that gave us 82 pips. Next up we were on the dollar in and we won 61 pips there. Next was the dollar swiss. And that was the cipher pattern that won 61 pips. And I'm sorry on the dollar again we actually only won 41 pips on it. Next was the pound dollar where we won 65 pips on the 786 trade. Next is the dollar cad where we had the 40 pips bat pattern. And also we had the structure based double bottom trade that banked in 67 pips. Next was the Aussie cad. With our 786 trade there we made 95 pips. And next came our two losers on the euro Aussie. One for 78 pips. And another loss for 73 pips. And last but not least was the euro pound. And on that trade we made 38 pips. Let's drag this down. And here. And as you can see so far a steady climb but every week will not be like this. We'll have more drops like this and eventually a drawdown that'll bring us back to reality within the next few months. But so far since starting my youtube channel on 11 16 I've produced somewhere around 32 trades and I am 61% accurate with 21 wins 13 losses and have made somewhere around 668 pips.
