What's up traders? Welcome to another video. Steven here your honest trading coach and it's been quite some time since I have not got a question at least once a day about buy stop or sell stop orders. And for that reason I decided to dedicate today's video completely to that type of order. Buy stop and sell stop orders can increase the accuracy of a trading strategy. They can help with your timing in the markets and provide a much better risk reward ratio if used correctly. So in today's video what I'm going to do is walk you through what these types of orders are. Then we're going to talk about how to place these types of orders on a trading platform. And finally after that I'm going to talk to you about some practical ways you can use buy stop and sell stop orders to start improving your trades. So if that sounds good to you and if that's something you're interested in go ahead and click that subscribe button down below the video. We do videos like this each and every week. Click the like button for me to help out with the YouTube algorithm and follow us over on Instagram at the trading channel. And I'll be right back to talk to you all about buy stop and sell stop orders. See you soon. Welcome back traders and firstly I'm going to apologize for the bad audio quality. I'm actually on vacation and I forgot my mic back at home so that's why if my voice sounds a little muffled that's going to be the reason. But let's go ahead and move on with the video starting with what is a buy stop and a sell stop order. Well a buy stop order is an order that is executed at a specific price that is above the current price of a financial instrument and a sell stop order is directly gobs it. A sell stop order is an order that is executed at a specific price that is below the current price of a financial instrument. So looking at the chart on the screen right now what that means is that if you wanted to place a buy stop order then you would need that order to be above 1.25 excuse me 1.1257 so your stop order would need to go above price anywhere above price is fine as long as it is above price for a sell stop order we'll color that red. What it means is that you're entering the market you you are placing an order to enter the market at a specific price below where price currently is so in this case with a sell stop order you would need to enter the trade at a price or have an order at a price that was below 1.1256. Now why would you want to do this just let's quickly go over the reason behind something like this well if there was let's say a big daily level of structure right here at 1.2 1.1266 and you thought okay well if this market the euro dollar one hour chart goes below this previous engulfing candle I think that that means this market is going to start heading way lower well if that's the case you may want to have a sell stop order right here and because of that sell stop order being there once the market pushes down and hits that your broker will enter you into a trade at this sell stop order price and you can have a designated stop laws and target set within that order as well we're going to go over all of that in just a second I just want to be clear with you about what a buy stop and sell stop order is to go over that one more time very briefly a buy stop order is an order that is going to be above where current price is and when the market gets to that order your broker will enter you into a trade at that specific price you can then set a designated stop loss and target a sell stop order is directly the opposite and it's what we just went over so hopefully now we have a good idea of what these orders are what we're going to talk about now is how we can actually use these orders on a trading platform so let's do that now I'm currently on trading view which is my trading platform of choice your broker or platform may be slightly different but for the most part most trading platforms will have three types of orders you can use if you look right here you see market limit and stop stop is what we're going to be talking about today the stop order all you have to do is click the stop order and then figure out if it's going to be a buyer sell do you want to be buying when the market starts to head higher we'll talk about how to use these in just a second but do you want to be buying if the market breaks through a specific price or do you want to be selling if the market goes below a specific price with that being the case you would either click a buy stop or sell stop let's say we want to buy the market if we break above these most recent eyes right here at 1.127 if that was the case and we wanted to buy the market at 1.127 and one of the benefits of this is let's say you didn't have the time to just sit right in front of your computer but you knew you wanted to buy if the market got above 1.127 throughout the day let's say you had something else another obligation that you had to go do well what you would do is set your buy price your buy stop price at 1.127 and I mean I like to use this type of order for breakout trades and we're going to discuss that in just a second I'm going to go through some practical ways you can use these orders to help improve your accuracy give you a better risk for reward ratio and to time the markets even better than you can with the market order in just a few minutes but this would be the order set up as is right now you would put the amount of units you want to say you did a standard buy you would put the amount of units that you want to purchase at that specific price and what that means is that if the market again you're saying if the market breaks out of this high I expect it to go higher the higher the green candle right here if the market breaks out of that high I expect that we're going to go a lot higher this is not a strategy again I'm just giving you examples to show you how to use a buy stop order if that was the case this is the way that would be set up owned by 100,000 units of the euro dollar at 1.127 so if the market gets there that's exactly what your broker will do if you click buy if you actually execute this order that's what would happen now you're broker and platform will more than likely have this as well you'll have an opportunity to place your stop in your target so let's say you wanted to stop loss below the previous candle loads right here and you wanted a target of a two to one we can make that happen really quickly here and I'll go ahead and show you this order I'll delete it right afterwards because this is not a trade I actually want to place but I'll show you actually placing the order right now so we have our entry we want to enter the market at 1.127 we have our stop loss price below the lows of those candles so that would be right there let's say we want a 1.5 to 1 risk reward there is a 1.5 right there so now we can actually put in our stop loss price and our take profit price so for the stop loss price we can actually use pips to make this very easy it would be 32 pips stop and for the target we have about 49 pips and all that's left to do now is click buy and at that point you have an order placed and if the euro dollar heads up and hits that order you will be entered into the trade your stop loss has already set your targets already set so you are good to go in terms of this specific trade now let's take a look at the ops example of a sell stop order before moving on to some practical ways you can use this type of order for breakout trades and more accurate entries okay so for a sell stop order let's say you wanted to enter if the market went below 1.1248 and you wanted to stop loss above the highs over here and you wanted to put your target down here at this previous support level again this is not a strategy of an economy just giving you this as an example of how to use a sell stop order what you would do is you would go ahead and get to however you place a trade in your trading platform for me it's just right clicking on the chart you're on trading view going to create a new order remember this time we wanted to do a sell order it's a sell stop order with that being the case we want the order to be at 1.1248 so 1.1248 and let's do the same standard line and we can now set a take profit in a stop loss and say you want your stop loss above these highs we talked about the target being down here at these previous lows with that being the case this order would have a stop loss of around 1.1280 and that's perfect where it's at and we would have a take profit at 1.1202 1.1202 and clicking the sell button right now we set you up with about 1.5 to 1 risk reward we can see our 1.4 right here and this is one of the reasons i love trading view as a platform it gives you your risk on the trade i'm risking 0.24 percent of the account right now and it gives you your risk reward right here in the middle so in this case you would just click if you wanted to sell this and you wanted to place this actual order and there you go just like that your order is placed and you're good to go on this specific trade so now that we've went over how to actually place these types of orders in a trading platform what i want to do now is show you some practical applications one of them being using this to get better accuracy on entry reasons and the second way showing you how to actually use this in order to trade breakouts in a very specific strategy in a specific way of using buy stop and sell stop orders to get a really highly accurate opportunity out of trending markets all right so for the next part of the video i'm going to teach you a little strategy that's extremely simple and then i'm going to show you how you can use buy stop and sell stop orders to increase the accuracy of almost any strategy and almost any entry reason let me go over briefly the strategy i'm going to teach you right now what i'm looking for essentially are candles that look like the one you see on your screen and this candle it's just a candle in which the body of the candle closes and opens or the entire body of the candle is within the top third of the entire candle from the low to the high so the way i point these out is i pull the fibonacci retracement from the low of the candle to the high of the candle and i have a fibonacci retracement level at 33.3 percent giving me the top third of the entire candle from low to high so with this being the case what i'm going to be looking for is these candles i call it a 33.3 candle and i'll be looking for these above the 20 period ema right now this blue line you see on the screen is the 20 period ema that is an extremely simple version of the strategy feel free to take it and use it as you will don't use it right now take it test it build a trade and plan around it do all the necessary steps but this is something that you are free to go test for yourself and this is what we're going to be using for this example so let's go ahead and take a look here we have our 33.3 percent candle that you just learned and what we're going to be doing is looking for one of those candles above the blue line which is our 20 ema all right that looks like one right there let's go ahead and check we have our fibonacci retracement tool remember we're pulling from the low of that candle to the high of that candle are we above our black line which is 33.3 percent of the entire candle the entire body of this green candle is in fact in the top third of the entire candle so that means if i was trading this specific strategy i would have an entry here at the close of the candle i would just place a market order right a stop loss below the wake of that candle below the low so somewhere like that and a target let's just say for example sake at a two to one risk reward which would look something like this now this being the case and this is where i'm going to teach you how to improve the accuracy of an entry reason and the accuracy of a strategy using these buy stop and sell stop orders if this was the case let's see what would have happened to this trade we would have pushed down down and then eventually stopped us out now what i'm going to do is back the chart up one more time at this point let's say we're looking for the same entry reason but instead of placing an order as soon as that entry reason happens instead of placing a market order let's say we want to place a buy stop order above price for confirmation we want to place a buy stop order above that entry candle and use that as extra confirmation so as we're pushing forward we get our entry candle right but we don't just place a market order at the close of that candle what are we going to do we're going to place a buy stop order three pips above the high of the entry candle we're using this as extra confirmation to give us more accuracy on this trading strategy and on this entry reason so if the high of this candle is 1.1037 we would go 1.1040 and that will now be our entry is a little bit higher than that 405 so now let's see what happens on this trade we push up we don't we don't quite close above or get above our entry price so at this point we haven't even been entered into the trade we continue continue and because we've already hit our stop now we wouldn't keep this order we would delete the order and this being the case we would have missed a losing trade or we would have avoided losing money on this specific trade and the only thing we did differently was placed a buy stop order above our entry trigger now you'll hardly ever it will happen from time to time but you're hardly ever lose a trade because of doing this because if the market's going to take off it normally takes off and will hit your stop order at that three pips above your entry candle whereas if the market's going to push down like it just did you avoid that losing trade by having that buy stop order above price let's take a look at one more example so i can show you a little more about that so right here we have another candle that looks to be it's above the 20 ma so let's go back to our strategy we have our blue lines 20 ma this is the candle i'm talking about the color of the candle does not matter we just need to make sure that this candle the entire body of it is above the top third of the candle so if we pull a Fibonacci retracement we have the entire body above 33.3 percent of this whole candle so with that being the case this would be an entry right well even if we used our three pips above as an entry and our stop loss and our two to one target we would have won this trade so it really doesn't get you out of very many winning trades again it will happen from time to time but what it does do is helps you to avoid losing trades therefore increasing your accuracy on almost any trading strategy and almost any entry reason that you use the thing the same thing would apply to any candlestick pattern that you've used for entry if used an engulfing candle using the buy stop order above it or sell stop order below it would help you to increase accuracy of that entry reason depending on your trading strategy so that's one way to increase accuracy using the buy stop and sell stop orders the sell stop would just be the opposite you'd be looking for entry reason to go short and you would be putting your sell stop below let's say this is your entry reason you'd be putting a sell stop below that same stop and same target so that's a little bit about how to increase accuracy now what i want to do is show you how to capture really accurate moves if the market's trending using these buy stop and sell stop trades so let's take a look at that so let's go take a look at that right now all right so now what i want to show you is an advanced way of using buy stop and sell stop orders in order to trade breakouts with really high momentum to get a really good risk to reward ratio on a trade so a very important note here is that you want to have some type of catalyst before looking for an entry like this for me a catalyst is either something news based that i know is going to push that market around pretty well or a major level of structure here on the europe dollar we have a major level of daily structure pointed out in red so what i would want to see is a catalyst is this market gets that level and be pushed down immediately from it and what i define being pushed down immediately from it as is if this market hits that level and then crosses below that 20 ema we were just looking at the blue line on the screen is still the 20 ema so we've come up into our level we're now pushing down if we get a cross below the 20 ema at this point i'm going to start looking for possible breakout trades and the reason is that we've had a catalyst the catalyst being the catalyst for me thinking that this market's going to keep going lower being this heavy daily level of structure resistance so if that being the case we've pushed down and what i'm going to start looking for is this first swing low after this push down that crosses below our 20 ema when i get that swing low i'm going to put a sell stop order right below it expecting this market to break out and push down because of that daily catalyst and because if we do this if we do break below this swing low then we're starting to make new lows and lower lows and lower highs are what it takes to start a downtrend so essentially what i'm doing is try to capture the first move on a downtrend that hopefully will last much longer and give me a really good risk to reward ratio so let's go ahead and take a look at what the market does as we continue to push down here we'll start looking for that first swing low and there we go that i would consider the first swing low here on the europe dollar with that being the case and the swing low i'm talking about is right here i would have a sell stop order let's color it red since it's a sell stop order and i would have that order a few pips below that swing low and what i'm going to be telling my broker is that if the market comes to this level if we cross below this level what this sell stop order is going to do is enter me into the market at around 1.0920 after it does i'm going to set my stop loss and target accordingly but let's just go ahead and take a look at what the market continues to do we're pushing down lower lower still haven't hit our order and there we have now hit our order so we would have been entered into this trade and once entered into this trade what i like to do on these breakout trades in order to get myself a really good risk to reward is to put a stop loss just above my entry candle so this stop loss is actually set at a really nice place as is so i'll leave that at around 20 pips for the stop and for a target i would like to get targets off somewhere around the previous support level of the previous uptrend before hitting that daily level and pushing down so with this being the case it sets me up with a three to one risk reward ratio let's just hit the play button here and see how this trade would have played out as you can see we're pushing down like i said earlier essentially we're trying to capture a move down in the beginnings of a downtrend that can hit a really nice risk reward and as you can see here that has done so and for this type of trade it would be exactly the opposite for a buy trade what we'd be looking for for a buy stop is the market to hit let's say a daily level of major structure push up cross above our 20 ema we'd be looking for that first swing high put a buy stop order above that first swing high and we'd be looking to capture the beginnings of an uptrend to get a really good risk to reward ratio on that trade so that's a look at an advanced way of using this to trade breakouts something really important to remember about this and if you're a beginner you probably don't need to be trying this quite yet but if you're someone more advanced in your trading career then something to remember is that you want to have that catalyst there must be a news event there must be this market coming off a major level of structure breaking below or above the 20 ema before looking for trades like this otherwise this type of strategy will eat you alive and probably cause you to lose money and of course as with all of my videos here at the trading channel do not take this and start trading it right now you want to go test this for yourself and see if it actually provides an edge over the market not only that you want to back test it created trading plan around it and actually do the proper work before risking real money and if you enjoy content we do have the eap training
