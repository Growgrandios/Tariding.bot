Hey traders, it's Monday, hopefully you've already done some pre-market analysis to prepare yourself for the week ahead, if not, or even if you have, but you would still like to follow along with us as we do top down analysis on some of the major pairs here in the 4X market, then make sure to stick around for this entire video. My name is Stephen, you're Honest Trading Coach. If you're new, then welcome here to the Trading Channel, and a few moments we'll be breaking down some of the major pairs and talking about our trading ideas on these pairs for the upcoming week. Today, here on the Eurodollar, not much has changed since last week on this pair. Throughout the past couple of weeks, actually we've been looking at the area between 1.22 and 1.25. This entire area has been considered a period of consolidation for us. So what we've been looking for for the past couple of weeks is bounces off this level of support and bounces off this level of resistance. Nothing has changed since then, we still haven't made it to the 1.25 area. We are heading in that direction. So if this market, the Eurodollar can push up to 1.25 and give us some type of reason to go short, then that's what we're going to be paying attention to here for this week on the Eurodollar. And I'm actually going to take this down to a smaller timeframe and show you guys in a little bit more detail how we can use this analysis to break down and make predictions about these pairs. So let's go down to a 4-hour chart. Okay guys, so here we actually, although we're in this consolidation period on a daily chart, here we've broken into what we can consider a trend reversal. Why is that? Well, we have this 1, 2, 3, break of structure resistance, 3 move. After this 1, 2, 3 move, we're not necessarily in an uptrend now on this timeframe, but we've done something different. We were pushing down, breaking into new lows, breaking into new lows. Now we've broken into a higher high. So this is a possible trend reversal. In this specific scenario, we can look right down here at the most previous level of structure that was broken for possible long opportunities. And that's what we're going to be looking at this week as well. If we can get a push all the way up to 1.25, we'll look for short opportunities. If this market starts to pull back, we'll expect that pullback to get into the most previous level of structure that was broken. And we'll be looking for possible trades off that area, possible bounce back up into 1.25. So that was a quick breakdown of the Euro dollar. We do have 4 other pairs we have to go through today and I'd like to keep this video under 15 minutes. So what I'm going to do is go ahead and move on to our next pair, which is going to be the dollar in last week's prediction that we had here on the dollar in worked out perfectly. So what we're going to do is take a look at a clip from that video and then we'll come back and break it down a bit further and also talk about what we're expecting next here out of the dollar in. So let's go ahead and take a look at that clip and I'll be right back. So what do I mean by that? Well, we have our move down our lower high until we break above that lower high until we get a breakout above this level. Our prediction remains the same that this market is going to continue lower and break into new lows. So with that analysis done, what does that mean for our trading? Well, that means we're going to be looking for opportunities to go short here on the dollar in and how can we do that? Well, we can look at levels of support and resistance on lower timeframes and I can guarantee you all these levels I'm pointing out are major levels on lower timeframes like the one hour and four hour chart. So going further into this week here on the dollar in, we're going to be looking for opportunities to short this market at one of these levels of major structure on a lower time frame. All right, guys. So back here on that dollar in chart, we were expecting trend continuation in this pair to continue lower and what happened? Well, we pulled right back up into that major level of structure we were talking about in last week's video and we got exactly what we expected. This market pushed down creating new lower lows. So that can be the power of using this type of analysis to predict market moves. But of course, guys, I do have to mention that it does not work out every single time. This type of analysis doesn't always work. And I know I mentioned that a lot. If you're subscribed here, if you see these videos every single week, then you know that I almost talk more about this not working than this working. And the reason for that is because there are so many traders out there that because of false information on the internet believe that there's strategies that work 100% of the time. There's a way to analyze the market where you're never wrong. And that's just not reality. That's not the case. At least it's nothing that I have found so far in my trading career. And I've been doing this profitably for over six years. I've been researching ways to trade constantly for the full six, seven years I've been trading. And I've never found a way to predict 100% what the market's going to do. But what this type of analysis does do for me at least in my analysis is gives me a statistical advantage. I know that placing trades like this, I have a higher percentage chance of winning than losing. And I know that if I do that consistently over time, it equals profit. So moving on from that, as you can see last week's predictions worked out really well here on the dollar yen. Let's talk a little more about what we're expecting next out of this pair. Well, for our initial predictions this week, we're going to go ahead and turn this line to red. More resistance we did break below and close below the 105.5 area because of that. Now we're looking at this area as possible resistance. The market's actually pushed right up into that area. So what I'm thinking here is we could have this zone that I'm drawing in now because of these wicks and these other previous major levels of structure on lower timeframes. This entire zone will be a spot between 105.5 and 106. That little 50-pip area there is going to be a zone where I'm looking for possible short opportunities. Again, same exact thing looking for trend continuation here out of the dollar yen to push this market lower. If we get lower, breaking below our previous lows, then our next counter trend possible area here at the trading channel is going to be 103.94. That'll be a level that we look for possible long opportunities right around the 104 even handle again for our next counter trend possible long opportunities. But initially expecting trend continuation here out of the dollar yen. So we'll see how that works out here in the next few days. Now we'll go ahead and move on though to our next pair which is going to be the Aussie dollar. Here on the Aussie dollar we have another pair that last week's analysis worked out perfectly on. So what we'll do is take a look at a clip from last week's video on this pair and of course directly after that we'll break that analysis down a little bit further and also take a look at what we're expecting and our predictions for this market coming into this current week. So I'll go ahead and play that clip and I'll be right back. On the Aussie dollar to push the market down. So again just to briefly go over this once more, the Aussie dollar is currently in what we're considering a downtrend reason being because we had this pushed down, pushed back up into a lower high, pushed down breaking and closing below our previous lows. At this point we're looking for that lower high to help us capture trend continuation out of the Aussie dollar. With that being our expectation where the market is hovering around now in my opinion is a great place to start looking for some short opportunities here out of the Aussie dollar and that's exactly what we're going to be doing throughout this week here on this pair. So I move on to our next pair which will be the pound. So as you can see the market fell quite dramatically from that 0.7881 area we expected a fall from in last week's prediction we talked about looking for a trading opportunity from to the short side. We got that pushed down into trend continuation breaking below our previous lows. Exactly what we expected. The market came into another daily level of structure and pushed up in this pullback since then. Now what are we expecting out of the Aussie dollar after this? Well we've just pushed up into another major level of structure right here. We know that's a major level of structure because the market has found it and used it as support multiple times. The market then got pushed down from that level. So right now we're just kind of hovering in between these levels of support and this level of resistance. What does that mean for us currently? What means we're not looking for anything at the moment here on the Aussie dollar. But what we can expect is a possible move back up into this zone and I can look for some possible trading continuation out of that area pushing the market down breaking into new lows. So our initial expectations here on the Aussie dollar is a push up into this zone and trend continuation but this market will be in trend continuation until we break above these previous highs around 0.79. So if we get up here and do not get some kind of entry reason in this zone we'll be looking right back at 0.79 for possible shorting opportunities that could push this market into trend continuation. As for long trades here on the Aussie dollar and a counter trend mindset what we're looking for is a possible retest of 0.7674 and entry reasons on a lower time frame to possibly use this as a long opportunity. Again it's going to be counter trend so it's not quite as likely of a scenario as our trend continuation scenario we just discussed. And that's a breakdown of the Aussie dollar. Now we'll go ahead and move on to our next pair. Our next pair is going to be the pound dollar. Okay guys so here we are on the pound dollar and before we break down this chart talk about what we're expecting next out of this pair. What I want to do is go back to a previous video we did. We did this video last week it was titled. If you're not doing this then you may fail at trading. In this video we talked about how important it is to actually have rules around your trading. And I'm going to take this down to a four hour chart and explain to you guys a little more about why that's the case and also show you a clip from that video. So in last week's video the one that I'm talking about if you're not doing this then you may fail at trading which there'll be a link for in the description and I'll put a card in the top right hand corner of the screen as well. If you haven't seen that video I highly recommend you go and check it out. It's one of the more popular videos on the channel. Again we released it last week and already got almost 10,000 views so make sure to check that out if you get a chance. But in that video we talked about the importance of rules and we also talked about the importance of picking what kind of trader you're going to be at the beginning of your trading career. Because if you're not profitable yet then I think it's an extremely good idea for you to pick either being a counter-trend trader or a trend continuation trader. So in last week's video we predicted four trend continuation traders that this market could pull back into this zone and then head higher in trend continuation. I'm going to show you guys a clip from that first and then we'll come back here discuss a little more about rules based trading, the importance of it and break down what we're expecting next out of the pound dollar this week. So I'll go ahead and play that clip and I'll be right back. So here on the four hour chart of the pound dollar what do we have? We have a market that has found a new uptrend right? We came from these lows here up to a high, new higher low, new higher high, new higher low, new higher high. Trend continuation traders what are we expecting? Well we're expecting a pullback into one our most previous level of resistance that was broken to down here at our level of support. One of those two areas would be great areas to look for support and to look for a reason to enter going long right? So back here on the pound dollar guys you can see that we did pull back into this previous level of resistance and we ended up getting a nice push into trend continuation. What happened after that? We pulled back into our next previous level of resistance that we broke and we've pushed up into trend continuation since then as well. And why in last week's video did we talk about rules based trading being so important and also not only that why did we talk about picking either trend continuation or counter trend trading if you're not yet profitable instead of trading both? Well there's a very simple reason for that. It can get extremely confusing. If you're trying to trade counter trend and trend continuation as a beginner at trading because in the market there are multiple reasons to go long and short at almost any given time. So that can make your decision making extremely difficult even if you have a rules based system if you're trying to trade counter trend and trend continuation unless you're extremely experienced. So in order to avoid all of that confusion if you say I'm only a trend continuation trader then what you're waiting for is a breaking close above a previous level of resistance and your rules to be met on a pullback whatever they may be maybe you trade it previous resistance maybe you trade it previous support maybe you use Fibonacci retracement whatever your rules may be and then waiting for your entry reason to go long once more in trend continuation. So then you're no longer looking for levels in the market to use for counter trend opportunities and you avoid a lot of confusion. So I just wanted to briefly talk about that but now let's go ahead and go back out to a daily chart and talk about what we're expecting next out of the pound dollar. Now here on the daily chart we're in a similar situation to the euro dollar. What do I mean by that we're in this period of consolidation. We have the 1.425 level of resistance the market hasn't been able to break above and we have this level down here at 1.3875 that the markets had trouble breaking below. We also have not had a one two three move we had one here we had a push down push higher push lower now we've had a break above resistance but we need this one to break above three move to put us into any type of reversal situation where we're expecting this market to head higher here on the daily chart. Now as we just saw on the four hour time frame we are in an uptrend so another little piece of advice I would have is only stick to one time frame if you're newer to trading because if you go through multiple time frames you'll notice that some time frames may be in a down trend while others are in an uptrend so sticking to one time frame again makes it a little easier and will avoid some of that confusion. But in our current situation here on the pound dollar our initial expectation is going to be a move into that is not a straight line excuse me a move into 1.25 excuse me 1.425 and we're going to be looking at that level on lower time frames for possible shorting opportunity here on the pound dollar because this pair is in a period of consolidation. After that if we get a push down to the 1.4110 level that's going to be a great place to look for possible long opportunities to push this market higher and that's what we're going to be taking a look at throughout this week here on the pound dollar. Let's go ahead and move on to our final pair now which is going to be the dollar Swiss. So as for the dollar Swiss we've recently broken into a new uptrend. Why do I say that and why is that the case because we had a downtrend here pushing and breaking below our previous low after that what has happened we have pushed up into a new high followed by our two move right we have one that break push above our previous resistance into a new high or two that pull back and three a breaking closeable above our previous resistance level. So now that we have our one two three move we can expect this to be some type of reversal situation we have an idea that the market could had higher from this level. So what we can look for is a possible trading opportunity right down here at the previous level of structure support. We've already tried to capture this in the EAP training program right up here and we ended up being stopped out of that trade the market as you can see pushed lower since then but now our next spot for possible trading continuation out of this pair are not even really trading continuation but a possible reversal trade is right here at this previous level of support. So that's what we're expecting initially out of the dollar Swiss is a push up higher from this level at least a retest of 0.9590 and that's what we're going to be paying attention to here on this market going into this week and that's a breakdown of the top five major pairs and our expectations here at the trading channel on each of them. If you're finding it difficult to get past that wall of becoming profitable and you'd like some more advanced training on the actual rules based systems that we use here at the trading channel every day in the markets along with training on risk management and discipline then I would suggest checking out the EAP training program.
