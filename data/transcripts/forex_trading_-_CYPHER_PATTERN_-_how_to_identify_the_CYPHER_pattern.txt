Hey everyone, Steven here from the Trading Channel. In today's video, I'm going to be showing you how to identify the Cypher pattern. And as with all of my strategy tutorials, it is important for you to back test these strategies on the particular pairs and particular timeframes that you trade and to make sure these types of strategies fit into your trading plan and your trading style. Without further ado, I will let the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll be back shortly. To share with you how to identify the Cypher pattern. Alright guys, so as with all of the other advanced patterns, the Cypher pattern starts with an impulse leg and the very first point of the move is called X. This is the X point and the X to A leg of the move is an impulse leg up or down. In this case, we're doing a bullish Cypher pattern is what we're drawing. So it's going to be a strong move to the upside. X up to A is your second point of the move. And the first rule of the Cypher pattern is a retracement from X up to A. And this retracement has to come down and touch the 382 but cannot close below the 618. So we have a little zone right in here where the market can terminate between the 382 and the 618. But the market cannot close below the 618. So for instance, if we have a candle here like this red one here, I've drawn and the wick comes down below 618 then that is still a valid B leg of the Cypher pattern. But if we come down and the body of the candle closes below the 618 that invalidates the pattern. So this would not be a Cypher pattern. This would still be a Cypher pattern. I hope you understand that. Moving on, the next rule of the Cypher pattern is a Fibonacci extension from X to A and back down to X that comes up into a 127 but does not close above 1414. So using the same example we did down here, this candle can come up that close to the 1414 and as long as it does not close above the 1414 even if we have a wick that comes up like this, that is still a valid Cypher pattern. Now if the body comes up and closes above the 1414 like this, then that invalidates the pattern. And this creates the C leg of the move. Down here was B and here is the C leg of the Cypher pattern. The next step for the Cypher pattern is placing the orders at the finishing point D. And the way we find finishing point D is a retracement from X down here all the way up to C and what you do is you put it on the wick of the candle. So if this C leg had this candle here, then it would be X all the way up to the wick of that candle and D is going to be the 786 retracement. And that is where my limit orders would be sitting if I was trading this Cypher pattern. Now there is one more rule to the Cypher pattern that I do not hear mentioned as much as it should be and that is that the B leg, once you pull from X all the way up to A to get your D, your finishing point of this Cypher pattern, the B leg cannot touch the 786. So if this candle was our B point of the Cypher pattern, then that would invalidate the Cypher pattern because B comes below the 786 retracement. So if we pull from our X all the way up to our C for our D point completion and B touches 786, then that invalidates the Cypher pattern. And I will draw this the rest the way in so you can see what it should look like. And that is your Cypher pattern using the ratios that I use. Now we will go into the market and I will show you an example of a few Cypher patterns that have happened in the previous weeks and also I will give you a clip of a live Cypher pattern that I traded a few days ago. I hope this all made sense, if it didn't and you have any questions about the Cypher pattern, then just leave them in the comment section below the video and I will do my best to answer those questions as quickly as I can. Not only Euro pound, 1 hour chart, we actually had a Cypher pattern hit this morning and it also came up to hit profits within a couple of hours of hitting our entry. I will give you a second to see if you can spot that and while you are looking for it, I will also show you this example of a bat pattern we took advantage of. If you are not familiar with the bat pattern, then I will post a link in the bottom left hand side of your screen to a tutorial that I did a while back on how to identify the bat pattern. As you can see here, we came up into our 886 retracement, the D point of our bat pattern and quite easily turned over to hit targets within the first couple of hours of being in the trade. You see in the Cypher yet, it comes from the C point of our bat pattern, X right here, up to A, A to B, B to C and a CD completion right down in there. Earlier this morning, that hit and as you can see, a pull retracement from C all the way down to D came up to quite easily hit targets at the 382 retracement. And targets and stops for the Cypher pattern. In order to get targets, you just pull from C up here, the extension, the 127 extension that cannot close above 1414, pull from that point down to the D point and targets go at the 382 retracement. Now you can trade this with extended targets, 1 at 382 and 1 at 618 retracement, but if you have a full time job, it is much easier to just take single targets with stops down below your X point. Now it would be worth while you are back testing checking out to see how often the market does hit 382 and 618 before turning around and stopping you out. So let's take a look at a couple more examples on the charts and then I will show you a live trade and hopefully you will have enough information to be able to go out and look through the charts and back test this for yourself to see if it fits in your trading plan. If we look here on the Euro pound yet again, just go ahead and delete all this. We actually have another Cypher pattern setting up for the bearish side. As you can see, pulling from X down here to A, we have a 382 retracement that does not close above 618. If we get our extension tool out and pull it from X to A and back up, you see that we have a 127 extension that does not close below the 1414 right here. So that creates a valid Cypher pattern trading opportunity. Up here, D at R786 retracement. And targets as usual go from C up to D on the Cypher pattern. You would be looking for targets down here at 382 and stops right up here above X. And now I will just show you a clip that I recorded a couple of days ago of me trading a Cypher pattern live in the markets. Here on the dollar swiss 5 minute chart we have a Cypher pattern setting up. And the Cypher pattern comes in from this X leg down here, this impulse leg from X to A is a 382 retracement without closing below 618. And then after that, we need a 127 extension from X to A. So we take our extension tool, X to A, back down in. And as we see, this does break above the 127 extension without closing above the 1414 extension. So take our triangle tool. And this is what this Cypher pattern looks like. Down here to the 786. And as you can tell, this Cypher pattern is already completed but has not yet come up to hit targets. So what I am going to do is place a limit order down at the 786 right here and try to see if this market can come back down and retest this level before going up and hitting targets. This will be at the 382 retracement. And stops will be just below X. Alright guys, so if this market does come down and retest our entry and we get involved in this trade, then I will keep you updated on how it plays out. So there we go guys, we have been filled on the dollar swiss Cypher pattern here. So the next step I am going to take is to go ahead and place my stops and targets. Stops right down here. And targets right up here. And we will see how this trade plays out right now bouncing around around the entry. And hopefully we will rally up a bit and come up here and hit targets. I will be back soon. As you can see guys, a little more than halfway to targets on this Cypher pattern on the dollar swiss. And what I really like about what the dollar swiss did at the Cypher pattern entry is all of these really long candle wicks we put in right at the Cypher pattern entry. And that makes me feel pretty good about this trade. So I will keep you updated the closer we get to targets. Alright, so we have got within one or two pips here hitting our profit target. So what I am going to do is take my stop loss here and move it up to break even so that I know I am in a risk free trade. I do not want to get up here and get that close to putting money in the bank and then turn around and actually lose money on this trade. So that is the reason I move my stop losses up is just to take all the risk off the table. Here we go guys, shot over just in time to see that we have actually hit targets on the dollar swiss Cypher pattern here. And this is just another live example of a successful Cypher pattern. Put a little money in the bank for us and I hope you enjoyed it. Alright guys, so that was it for my how to identify a Cypher pattern video. I hope it was educational.
