Hey guys and welcome to the trading channel. Thank you for joining me. In today's video we're going to be discussing whether or not we're using the correct stop-loss placement. Later on in the video we'll be talking about a few different ways that you can actually incorporate placing a stop-loss and although there are many Options we'll be talking about some of the best ways to implement a stop-loss into your trading plan So if you're interested in learning a little more about stop-loss placement Then make sure to keep it locked here through the intro and disclaimer If you're new here to the trading channel Then make sure to click that subscribe button to be alert and we come out with new free educational content and I will see you guys on the other side of the intro Welcome back traders So the ironic thing about today's video is that we had a trade this week that ended up being stopped out by less than three Pips before turning around and going in the correct direction that we expected it to over 200 pips And that's the trade you see on your screen here on the pound Swiss this trade is actually a trade that we sit out To everyone who signed up for our email list over at the trading channel net There'll be a link in the description if you'd like to sign up and get a free Potential trade set up each week as well and also there'll be a link in the top right hand side of your screen But this trade was a cipher pattern, right? This is an advanced cipher pattern and It came in right at a level of structure. This was a level of daily structure this red line here So we were in a downtrend and we had an advanced pattern entry while being in a downtrend and really close to a Potential reversals on in the first place really close to that daily level of structure which we know that can act as support and resistance here We expected that level to act as resistance which it did but unfortunately because of stop-loss placement the topic of today's video This trade was stopped out by three pips For a loss of around 60 pips before it turned around and went in the correct direction over 200 pips Now for us our second targets probably would have been taken off somewhere around this level which means that because of stop-loss placement we did not capture over a hundred and thirty pips of profit and The question becomes does that make this a good or a bad trade, right? That's what everybody begins to wonder whenever they have trades that lose like this when you have a trade that stopped out by two or three Pips you go man If you know if I just would have had a stop-loss five pips higher Then this trade would have won and I'd be sitting in a hundred pips of profit and I'd be taking my wife out to the Fantest restaurant in town tonight, but instead I lost money because of my stop-loss. So again, we asked the question Was this the correct stop-loss placement? And guys, there's a very easy way to figure out whether your stop-loss placement is correct now later on in the video We'll be going through a few different examples of how you can actually implement a stop-loss into your trading How a few different ways of calculating your stop-loss But for now, let's talk about how you know whether or not you're using the correct stop-loss placement and that very easy way that I'm talking about Is by having a trading plan guys so being able to determine whether or not you're using the correct stop-loss Means that you have to have a trading plan in place You have to have a strategy that has a set of rules and included in that set of rules is your specific stop-loss placement You've probably noticed if you've been watching a few different trading gurus or a few different trading professionals That are trying to teach trading online that all of them use different stop-loss placement Which I'm sure leads newer traders to believe I know it didn't me Which way is the best way you always look for that best way to use a stop-loss and The truth is the best way to use a stop-loss is the way that's already in your trading plan because your trading plan should consist of strategies That you have back tested in the market and forward tested along with done some live trading on at the point that you become Comfortable with that strategy and throughout that back and forward testing process You should have determined a specific way to set a stop-loss and no matter what anyone else is doing No matter what your favorite professional trader is doing no matter what I'm doing on a specific trade You need to implement your stop-loss because that's what's consistent with your trading plan and your trading plan is what has given you an indication that you have an edge over the market or is what should have at least you Should have a trading plan that gives you an edge over the market So if that's the case then you need to implement that trading plan on a daily basis in order to stay consistent with the results You had from your back and forward testing which gave you an edge over the market which made you profitable Throughout your back and forward testing process So the correct way to use a stop-loss is to use the stop-loss that is in your trading plan and guys on the trade the specific Trade that you see on your screen. That's exactly what we did I don't have any regrets about the trade that you see on your screen Although we were stopped out by three pips before the market turned around and hit what would have been a massive profit I do not regret putting my stop-loss exactly where it was at and the reason is because that's what's in my trading plan And I will do that over and over again and throughout time I will be profitable with that stop-loss placement included in my trading plan There are other traders that got this potential trade set up and actually sent me an email Explaining that they made massive profits on this trade and the reason is because they stuck to their trading plan on advanced patterns So they have a specific stop-loss that they use that's a little bit higher than mine And they managed to actually catch this trade so I'm gonna show you an email from one of the subscribers to our email list now All right guys, so here we are on that email and this is what the email actually looked like This was a potential trade set up email that sent out to all people subscribe to our email list over at the trading channel Dot net and as you can see it was a pound Swiss one hour short We're talking about this advanced pattern here this advanced cipher pattern and I had my stop entry and target listed Well, if I scroll down, you'll see an email from this trader if you look at me down here says Thank You Stephen last night. I followed your pound Swiss signal strategy and I profited 101 pips So using the stop-loss that this trader had ended up making him 101 pips where I lost 64 pips Now this was not meant as a signal and I hope this trader had advanced cipher patterns in his trading plan But nonetheless using a different stop-loss. He ended up capturing around 101 pip move now Does that mean that this trader was right and I was wrong? Absolutely not you're gonna get a lot further as a trader if you stop looking at things as right and wrong When it comes to did I lose that trader when that trade and you start looking at things whether or not you followed your Specific trading plan. So now that we've been over how you know whether or not you're using the correct stop-loss Let's go ahead and start looking at a few different ways that you can create a stop-loss Maybe you're brand new to trading or maybe you haven't yet started constructing your trading plan or your strategy And you'd like to know a few different options you have for creating a stop-loss. So let's go ahead and discuss those There's the most simple version of a stop-loss Which is gonna be a certain amount of pips and there's a couple of different ways You can actually do a stop-loss you can put a stop-loss above a swing level So for instance if we were to take this position tool off and let's just assume we have this cipher pattern here And we'll use this for our stop-loss examples Let's say we enter the market right here At this cipher pattern entry at the 786 retracement the question you have to ask yourself at this point is how much room Are you gonna give this thing how much of a stop-loss do you want? You have three main places where you can put a stop-loss you can either put a stop-loss above your entry Which means wherever you entered the market you can choose a specific way to add to that entry. Let's say we enter here Then you can choose to just put your stop-loss 10 pips above that entry 20 pips above that entry or you can use a variety of different Methods like ATR and stuff like that that will be going over a little bit later in the video But you can place your stop-loss above your entry. That's the first way the second main way is above your entry candle And these are in no specific order guys These are just the three ways that you can play to stop loss So the second main way is going to be above the entry candle Which means you go and take the high of the candle that entered you into the market Let's say we were going short here on this pound Swiss cipher pattern looks like this would have been the candle That entered us short. So because of that our stop loss would go again a certain number of pips above The swing high that we just pointed out now that certain number of pips can be calculated by just saying 10 to 20 pips It can be calculated by ATR. It can even be calculated by Fibonacci extensions But we'll talk about that a little later on for now Let's continue with this the third main way final place that you can put a stop-loss above is going to be your previous swing high And of course, this is the opposite for bullish setups You'd be putting your stop-loss below the previous swing low below your entry and below your entry candle for bullish setups But for this example, it is a bearish setup. So we would be putting a stop-loss above our previous swing high Again by a certain amount of pips or by ATR or by using a Fibonacci extension So those are the three main places that we can put a stop-loss now the second question You have to ask yourself after deciding which one of these three places You're going to put your stop-loss is how far above those places do you want to go again? How much room do you want to give this specific trade? To go against you and that also comes down to personal preference But you can use one of three main ways the first way is going to be a certain amount of pips So let's say we were using the swing high for this example We're putting a stop-loss above the previous swing high which is right here. So using this method We would take a roller tool of some kind and go above that swing high by 20 pips 10 pips Whatever you decide and that is where our stop-loss would go now the second way we can do this is by using The ATR indicator and for those of you that don't know what the ATR is It's the average true range and what it does is calculates the average amount the market has moved the average amount of pips The market has moved in the last 14 candles and that's the default setting for an ATR on most platforms is 14 You can change that setting, but that's irrelevant I use a 14 period ATR and as long as you Consistently use the same one throughout your back forward testing and live trading It's not gonna matter what this setting is and what you can do is just hover over your entry candle Whichever candle you use to enter the market and if you look up here to the top right hand corner of the screen I'll drag down this ATR indicator make it easier to see you can see a little number right up here I just circled it and That number is the ATR the average true range of the previous 14 candles plus the candle you're hovering over so if you hover over your Entry candle you can see if you'd look in that black circle I drew earlier the ATR is 19 so using one ATR stop-loss Would be putting a 19 pip stop-loss above this previous swing high now guys These are the same way if you're using the entry-based stop-loss Meaning putting a stop-loss just above entry you could use that ATR indicator or a certain amount of pips above that entry Or if you're using the entry candle which means your stop-loss would go above this high Right here the hive this candle weight So with all three of those places you can use these two examples You can either use a certain amount of pips above the swing high the entry or the entry candle or even use the ATR Above any of those three now you can also get really creative while using these ways of placing a stop-loss while you're in your back testing and forward testing process you can Increase the amount of your stop-loss if you're just using a number like instead of 10 to or 20 pips go 30 instead and see if that Increases your winning percentage and you can also decrease it instead of 10 use 5 and see how much that increases your risk reward And over a period of time you will see whether or not that's beneficial for the strategy now Also with the ATR indicator you can get really creative and you can say instead of one ATR stop-loss I want to use ATR times two which in this case would be 19 pips times two you can multiply that ATR indicator by two and use that as a stop-loss to see if it's beneficial for your specific strategy now this third and final way to set your stop-loss above your entry entry candle or swing high is most commonly used for advanced patterns or Strategies that have multiple swings guys and multiple swings would be like this right here We have a swing down and a swing high then another swing low so that's multiple swings And when you have a strategy that has multiple swings like this and we're gonna use advanced patterns as our example here today And this is getting a little advanced I'm sorry if I'm confusing some of you, but just bear with me it'll make sense eventually so For this advanced pattern we could go from the lowest point of our advanced pattern in order to calculate the stop-loss we could go from the lowest point of our advanced pattern here Which is the C point of the cipher pattern all the way up to the highest point of this pattern Which is the X point and we could drag down a Fibonacci extension now this you can get really creative with you can double click on this Fibonacci extension and you can change this to whatever number you would like now for this extension all it is is an extension of this total move so this total move is a a certain amount of pips is a certain distance and all These numbers mean let's take for example this first one at 1.16 All this extension line right here is is 1.16 times the distance between the swing low and The swing high that we pulled from So you can actually take and play around with that number by double clicking on the extension tool and changing it to whatever You would like and see which number gives you the most benefit in the specific strategy You're using and this is also extremely non subjective and easy to test and implement in live trading now As I said using this type of stop-loss will probably only work for multiple swing type strategies like advanced patterns But it is a really good non subjective way to place a stop-loss So guys there's a few different ways that you can implement stop-loss placement into your back testing into your foretesting and even into your live trading Once you're done with those two processes and guys I can already see some pretty negative comments coming out of this video I can imagine that we'll be receiving comments that say Putting 10 pip stop-loss above your entry is way too small You're not giving the market enough room and you're gonna lose trades And I'm sure we'll also see putting a stop-loss two times ATR Above your previous swing high is giving the market way too much room and you're sacrificing your risk to reward ratio And right now guys, I'm talking to the five to ten percent of you They're willing to actually work on your trading and that are willing to put in the work it takes to become profitable Be open-minded guys Don't let someone else's opinion of where you should place a stop-loss effect where you actually place your stop-loss If you're confused and you sometimes let that kind of thing get to you If sometimes you're letting the fact that I'm putting a stop-loss higher or sometimes you're letting the fact that your other Favorite trading mentor is is putting a stop-loss in a different place than you Then you're doing something wrong my friend your main objective should be to become an Independently profitable trader and independent is the main word in that guys be independent and the way to get to that independence is by creating that trading plan We were talking about earlier Backtesting a strategy in the market coming up with a stop-loss testing that strategy with that stop-loss over a period of a lot of trades and seeing if it gives you an advantage and if it does and Me and you trade the same strategy and I send out an email that says my stop-loss is 20 pips higher than yours Do not listen to that email because you are an independently profitable trader. That's what you want to go for for me personally Do you think that if I watch a video or? Hear from another trader that their stop-loss is higher than mine on the same trade that it affects me in the slightest No, it it does not change my opinion whatsoever It does not make me change my stop-loss at all. I don't even give it a second thought They have their reasons for placing their stop-losses where they do and I have mine So for the five to ten percent of you guys that are actually willing to put forth a lot of work and a lot of effort into your trading And do all you can to become a profitable trader Just remember to keep an open mind and remember that your main goal is to become independent and profitable So just keep that in mind as you go through the rest of your trading journey Don't forget to subscribe here to the trading channel if you're new for those of you who are interested in advanced patterns If you're interested in getting your hands on a 100% free Butterfly pattern tutorial then make sure to click the first link in the description to head over to the trading channel Dot net and sign up for email list and you'll also be receiving one of these free potential trade setups each week You enjoyed the content in this video make sure to click that like button comment below if you have any questions And it's telling me what you want to see next out of the trading channel I wish you guys all the best of luck on all your future trades, and I'll talk to you in the next video You
