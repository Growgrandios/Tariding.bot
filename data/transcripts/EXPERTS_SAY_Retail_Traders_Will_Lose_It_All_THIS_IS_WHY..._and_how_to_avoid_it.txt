Do you remember your parents telling you not to play in the street? I know I do. I remember my mother used to always tell me, Stephen don't go play in the street. There are cars out there that make it dangerous and if you do it will end extremely bad for you. That was pretty good advice. To this day I haven't played in the street and to this day I have not been hit by a car so it worked out well. What's my point? What does this have to do with trading? Well, what I'm going to show you how to avoid in this video if you do it would be equivalent to you playing in the street with your trading account. It would be dangerous and it would end extremely badly for you. This same exact mistake is something that I made at the beginning of my trading career that caused the biggest drawdown I've ever had of over 80% of my total account value. Throughout being a coach, I've watched hundreds of traders make the same mistake in a today's video. I have vowed that no other traders that see this video shall make this mistake and bleed their account to the point of no return. I'm very passionate about this and I can't wait to share it with you. So go ahead and click that subscribe button below the video and the notification bell to join the over 230,000 trader community we have here on YouTube and I'll be right back after the intro and disclaimer to show you what not to do if you like money. See you soon. Welcome back. And in just a second, I'm going to jump into my 80% drawdown story and help you understand how to avoid the mistake that caused that 80% drawdown to keep you from making that same mistake and losing majority or more of your account. But before I do that, there are some key concepts you have to understand for me to tell you the story. Starting with this one, I'm going to teach it to you right now. In financial markets, at any point, essentially financial markets are doing one of two things. They are either trending or consolidating. Let me show you what that looks like on a chart. Financial markets will always either be trending as we are doing here or they will be consolidating as we're doing in through here, just like this. This would be the area of consolidation. This would be the area of trend. Whenever we start trading and whenever I started trading, what led to that 80% drawdown is let me start like this. Every single strategy has a goal. You may be trading a trend like this. You may have a methodology that you only trade with the trend. You may be trading a reversal or counter trend strategy, but in doing so, you are trying to capture one of these two things. You are either trying to capture a huge trend or you're trying to capture a period of consolidation where you can catch reversals off support and resistance or reversal from a higher top break structure level. 90% of strategies will be doing one of those things. So what happens whenever you start to trade? What happened to me whenever I started to trade is sometimes you will start trading and let's say you're starting by trading a trend continuation strategy. Let's say you start by trading breakouts. That's actually one of the ways that I started was trading breakout patterns. If you're trading breakout patterns during a trending market winner, W, during a trending market, you're going to see winner W, plenty of winners trading this breakout strategy. So there was three wins. But what happens when you start trying to trade a breakout strategy in consolidation? Right here was the breakout loss. You lose. You lose tons of trades because breakouts are meant to capture trends. Now, if you're trading a reversal strategy or some type of strategy that deals with support and resistance in way of a counter trend strategy, if you try to trade at resistance here, you're going to lose. If you try to trade back at resistance here, you're going to lose. But when the market starts to consolidate, you are going to be winning at these levels of support and resistance. So consolidation strategies do just that. They work during consolidation. Trend continuation strategies do just that. They work during trending markets. You'll hear of different methodologies from professional traders. Some traders enjoy trading with the trend. Other traders are counter trend and they enjoy trading against the trend. The point is not whether your trend is going to be a trend or a trend or a trend. The point is what I'm going to get to in just a second. Before that, this is what happens. A trader will start trading, say they start trading breakouts, they will win a ton of breakout trades. They will go, Yes, I'm winning trades. This strategy is perfect. I fucking love it. The strategy is awesome. And then they'll get into this period of consolidation and they'll all of a sudden, you're going to lose equity in their account. When they start losing that equity, something that happens as they decide to switch strategies. The biggest takeaway from this video is going to be don't switch strategies. And this is why your trend continuation strategy that you had was working because the market was trending and it's not working because the market is consolidating. That is not going to be normal. And natural. This period of consolidation is going to cause what we call a drawdown for the remainder of the video. I actually want to go to an equity curve right here, a fake equity curve and show you what that looks like on an equity curve. A lot of times you hear of traders getting really lucky at the start. They start trading and they make 20, 30% in their first month or two and they're just ecstatic about that. And sometimes a more unlucky trader and really this is the lucky people, not unlucky, may start a trend continuation strategy here. The difference is both traders starting the same strategy at different times. The lucky one that made 20 to 30% the first month started a trend continuation strategy down here. Caught a lot of this. The unlucky one started trend continuation strategy right here. Either way, let's say you're this top trader. You're going to stop the strategy whether it works or not. And I'm going to show you how to avoid all this in the future. So stick with me. Whether this strategy works or not, you're going to stop trading during this period of consolidation. If you're trying to trade trend continuation because you're going to lose money, which is normal and natural, but something all new traders have the imagination, the sense of they have to avoid it. They want to avoid it. They want to lose money. Keep from losing money at all costs. And that's not at all possible. And I'll get into that later as well. But the lucky trader who starts down here, he will make income. He will make equity in his account and grow it until he gets right here and then switch strategies. This guy will start trading trend continuation and then realize trend continuation doesn't work. And then what do you think is going to happen next on the on the pound Swiss here on the one hour chart? It will eventually start to trend again. And if it starts to trend again, and the guy that was trading trend continuation right here decides to stop trading trend continuation and start trading a different strategy that's more of a reversal strategy or a counter trend strategy. What do you think is going to happen? He lost money here because he was trading trend continuation. And he as soon as he stops trading trend continuation, I lost too much money. Money went down and they he said, I'm going to start trading counter trend strategies because obviously that works better than trend continuation. And then the market's going to go into trend and he's going to lose money again. Let me show you what that looks like on an equity curve. So starting out, let's say you start with a trend continuation strategy and the market trends. You would do something like this with your let me shrink that up a bit. Sorry, guys. With your equity curve, it would look something like this. You may have a couple of little losses, but if the market's trending, you have a trend continuation methodology or strategy or system, then you are going to be making equity. But what happens is throughout this first month, let's say you make 20, 25%. And the market goes into a period of consolidation. I did this throughout my entire, the beginning, I guess, six to 12 months of my career. This is what caused me to bleed my account by 80%. I would consistently switch strategies. Main takeaway, be consistent, being consistent as a trader is beyond important. And this is why if you consistently switch strategies, you're never going to be able to capture the winning periods in the market. If you're a trader, the market will trend, will consolidate, you will have a drawdown, then the market will trend again. But eventually the market does trend again, and we'll start giving you equity. We'll start, you'll start actually winning trades again. But let's say you're making the same mistakes I made as a beginner and you're making the same mistakes. I see hundreds of traders make that go through our programs as a coach and that just reach out to me as I'm in contact with thousands of traders every week. So this is the mistake I see that trink continuation strategy that was working on the market. The situation strategy that was working stops working because the market goes into consolidation. And then right about here at the normal period of a drawdown, they go, Oh, shit, the strategy isn't working anymore. I have to switch strategies. They switch strategies from trink continuation to counter trend, just because it looks different than the strategy they've been using. And they think, okay, this one's different. This is something I have to use. So whenever the market's consolidating, they're in this drawdown, the market begins to trend again, but they've switched strategies to a consolidation strategy. So what that causes is another push down. And eventually during this consolidation, they have this push down and they go, Oh, this strategy fucking sucks. It's not working. I have to switch strategies again. They switch strategies again. They switch strategies again. And then they're going to be able to do that. So they switch strategies from consolidation to train continuation. And the market starts to consolidate and they lose money and then they'll switch and eventually maybe they get a little bump up. But unfortunately, at some point they switch again and they can never capture the big moves in the market or the trades they need to capture because they're consistently switching from trend to counter trend consistently switching strategies. And that would look like on an equity curve. It would look like you're doing pretty good whenever you switch initially and then the market would start to trend again or the market would start to consolidate again. And you would lose trades inevitably. And this is what it looks like to bleed an account through switching strategies consistently instead of being consistent with your trading. Being consistent with that trend continuation strategy system or methodology would look more like this. So you're going to push up. Yes. Losing trades, a drawdown. This period of consolidation though in the markets will end. Markets will eventually trend again. And then you'll have a good opportunity to make money during that trending market. Then the markets will consolidate again and then maybe continue to consolidate for a while. But eventually the markets will get back into trend. And this is what a normal equity curve looks like when you are a consistent trader. You must be a consistent trader in order to actually give yourself a chance to become successful and profitable and more importantly to avoid the major mistake of switching systems and bleeding your account slowly to over an 80% or 100% drawdown where you lose the entire account. That's what I want you to be able to avoid which is why I created this lesson today. Hopefully you can see how important it is to be consistent in your trading. And now let's switch gears for a second. Go back over to some different charts and talk about how we can actually implement this. Well, firstly, you need to decide are you going to be a trend continuation or counter trend trader. Neither is wrong. Both ways can equal profitable outcomes at the end of the year, but you have to be consistent with one of them throughout the entirety of the year in order to actually see good results. You can't consistently switch strategies and expect to see good results. It'll look like the equity curve I just shared with you where the person was switching strategies and slowly bleeding their account to the downside. You have to consistently trade trend continuation so that you capture the trends every time they happen trend trend. Yes, period of consolidation, but eventually we will trend again. If you stay consistent with your strategy, you can capture those trending moves, which is what is important and what creates that slow equity curve growth that we're all looking for as traders. So how you would do that is pick between trinkity, or counter trend and then create strategies. Your strategy can be, of course, extremely simple or as extremely complicated as you would like it to be. If you're trading breakouts, what you need to do is let's say you trade breakouts. Right here is a little breakout on the pound Swiss. You need to create conditions and entry reasons for breakouts. And you need to stick to those before you stick to those, though. You have to back test and see if historically these breakout patterns using the entry reason and the conditions that you create have provided you with an edge over the market. If they have back test, create a full trading plan around them by creating the times you can trade by creating a risk management plan and by sticking to all that by being disciplined and then take that information, plug it into a spreadsheet, decide whether it's something you want to actually trade, optimize your portfolio with the best currency pairs for trading breakouts. Yin pairs are a great place to start. They trend really well. Pound pairs tend to do the same thing. At that point, you have a full system that has been tested and verified to give you an edge over the market through historical data. And you can now take that system, demo trade it first to increase discipline, demo trade it first to make sure that you can actually produce profits with the strategy you've created in real time while looking at live moving charts. Then you're ready to go live with a very small account if you're comfortable doing so. 4X has its own risks and I would never tell someone to open a live account. That's completely up to you. But if you feel comfortable, that's the only time you need to be opening a live account and trading with a lot of money. The reason I did this rant, the reason I created this video was to help you avoid blowing your entire account, to help you avoid losing 80%. You have so many trading educators and gurus online that are teaching you the next best way to create 1000% gain this year. That's not practical for one possible barely and very, very, very unlikely. You have more of a chance of winning the lottery than of creating a system or making 1000% a year. So with that being the case, what do you really need to do? What you really need to do is understand how to avoid losing money. You have to have money in the game in order to make money so you can't lose your entire account. You can't get into an 80% drawdown like I did at the beginning of my trading career and expect to eventually become a super wealthy trader. You have to avoid these things first in order to become consistent and profitable. If this was helpful, go ahead and click that like button for me. Subscribe also.
