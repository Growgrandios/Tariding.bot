What is up traders welcome to the trading channel and welcome to today's video in today's video we're gonna be talking about three different trades We've had so far this week in the eap trading program We've had three trades this week in that program and all three have been winning trades Including the one you see on your screen that is currently up a little over 380 pips and just under two days in today's video We'll also be talking about the importance to sticking to your trading plan because although this week has proven to be extremely profitable So far here for the eap training program last week That was not the case and if we would have chose to stop trading our plan because of the struggles we had last week And the profits we've seen this week so far would not have been possible So if you're new make sure you go ahead and click that subscribe button and click the notification bell to be alerted When we come out with new videos like this and our weekly market predictions that we come out with every Monday to help you stay ahead In your trading also if you don't mind go ahead and click that like button for me while the intro and disclaimer roll And I'll see you guys on the other side you Welcome back guys, so I'd like to be completely transparent in these videos And I'm not just gonna tell you we had three winning trades in the eap Instead I'm gonna show you guys the email that was sent out to eap training program members that have these trade ideas in it So the first trade we're gonna take a look at is the pound New Zealand and let's go ahead and head over to that email Here's that email guys and if I click the details here You can see that this email was sent on Monday October 23rd 2017 at 1.02 p.m That's when this email hit the inbox of all members the first trade you see here's the pound dollar trade And we'll take a look at it in just a second But first let's take a look at the pound New Zealand trade if we scroll down here You can see that here we have this pound New Zealand trade and this trade was taken using a strategy that we have in the training program Called the pullback strategy now We're not gonna discuss all the rules for that strategy here in this video But as you can see in the email I do have an entry stop and target for this trade So let's head back over to the chart and discuss a little bit of the analysis behind this trade and also discuss why we were Interested in this as a trading opportunity in order to do so we need to zoom out to the daily chart So out here on the daily chart just as we do our analysis in the weekly market prediction videos and in the structure based trading videos Do you guys notice anything that may lead us to believe that this market could head higher? What about this right here? What about this close we had just above our previous resistance level? So this market here on the pound New Zealand came off of this base right down here pushed up after consolidating for a bit Finally broke above this resistance level here continued higher We consolidated a little here and then another impulsive move up another impulsive move higher But this one after the close of this candle here Broken closed above our previous level of resistance. So that gave me a long bias on this specific pair I wanted to go long and I needed to find a way to go long on a lower time frame and that's exactly what we did in the EAP It's pretty simple analysis But we do have specific entry reasons and rules that we use in order to make sure that we're getting the optimal Entry when the market is in this type of condition So as you can see this higher time frame analysis that we talk about each and every Monday in the weekly market predictions video Can be a really powerful tool to add into your trading plan and there was actually plenty of different reasons You could have entered a trade like this if we head down to a smaller time frame Let's say the one hour chart here. We have this break of resistance Here was our resistance level from that higher time frame market then pulls back and puts in this nice double bottom head Tire you could also have traded this like some type of simple pattern So as we were just talking about guys many different ways to get involved in this after seeing what condition the market was in on a higher time frame So what does this trade have to do with sticking to your trading plan? That's one of the main things we wanted to discuss in this video So the question is why does sticking to a trading plan really matter in order to answer that question We're gonna head over to the equity curve for the EAP All right traders So this equity curve is based on the email analysis that we send out three to five times a week to members And as you can see here is that equity curve So the reason sticking to a trading plan is so important is because just a couple of weeks back We went from a new equity high here and had a significant drawdown to here This is the position when most people give up in their trading. Let's pretend none of this back through here. It even exists Let's pretend you just started trading right here. You have a really good month or a really good week here In a little pullback you have a little drawdown right there Another really good week and then you lose every bit of that profit when you first start out say that happens within a matter of two or three weeks So in three weeks of trading the strategy or strategies that you've chose to put into your trading plan have produced no profit at all How likely are you to stick to that trading plan seeing this on an equity curve is very easy seeing it on paper is Extremely easy guys because we can see all of this beforehand as if you were to start trading right here I'm drawing that black dot it would have been a very frustrating time for you If you made 10% and then lost it all within three weeks so frustrating that I would assume for any newer trader or for anyone who's struggling with their trading This would probably enough for you to stop trading your trading plan And what would have happened if you would have done that you would have missed out on this big move up that we've had this week So that's why sticking to your trading plan is so important guys And without doing that is gonna be nearly impossible to be successful as a trader Once you have that proven to be profitable plan your entire purpose needs to be to come into the market every day and follow that plan To the best of your ability and that can be a very difficult thing to do on your own So if you need help with your discipline and trading psychology and help understanding how to follow a trading plan or even help Understanding how to create a trading plan then that's the entire purpose of the EAP training program And if you're ready to invest in your trading education, then there's a link for that program in the description below if not That's fine to guys.
